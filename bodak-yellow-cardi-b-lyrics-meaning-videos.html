Said I'm the shit, couldn't fuck with me if they wanted to

She confidently asserts that no one can compete with her, stating "Said I'm the shit, couldn't fuck with me if they wanted to." She makes it clear that she makes "money moves" rather than wasting time dancing or partying. She also emphasizes the value of her designer shoes by repeating, "These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes," and notes that she can afford to buy multiple pairs at once. Cardi B references her past as a stripper when she says, "My pussy feel like a lake, he wanna swim with his face." Meanwhile, she also takes shots at some of her haters, saying that if she sees someone and doesn't speak, it means she doesn't like them. The song finishes with a short verse where Cardi B suggests that she has even more money coming to her.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Said I'm the shit, couldn't fuck with me if they wanted to</u><br>I'm confident in my abilities and status, no one can compete with me</p><br><p><u>I don't gotta dance</u><br>I don't need to dance or perform to prove myself</p><br><p><u>Said little bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to</u><br>No one can mess with me, I'm too powerful and successful</p><br><p><u>These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes</u><br>I'm rich and can afford luxury items like these famous red-bottomed shoes</p><br><p><u>Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose</u><br>I can buy both pairs of shoes if I want, I don't want to make a decision</p><br><p><u>And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable</u><br>I won't hesitate to drop someone from my life if they become a liability</p><br><p><u>Look, I don't dance now, I make money moves</u><br>I'm focused on my career and making money, not on dancing or entertaining</p><br><p><u>If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you</u><br>If I ignore you when I see you, it's because I don't want anything to do with you</p><br><p><u>I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves</u><br>I'm in charge and successful, and will do whatever it takes to succeed and eliminate competition</p><br><p><u>If you a pussy you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp</u><br>If you're weak or an enemy, you'll face consequences</p><br><p><u>And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich</u><br>I recently checked my bank accounts and realized I'm very wealthy</p><br><p><u>I put my hand above my hip, I bet, you dip, he dip, she dip</u><br>I strike a confident pose and challenge others to copy it</p><br><p><u>My pussy glitter as gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role</u><br>I'm valuable and powerful, and won't let anyone take advantage of me</p><br><p><u>I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith</u><br>I just arrived in a high-end car (Rolls Royce) and previously arrived in another (Wraith)</p><br><p><u>No, I need to fill up the safe</u><br>I need to save and protect my money</p><br><p><u>I need to let all these hoes know that none of they niggas is safe</u><br>I'm aware of others trying to date my significant other, and letting them know they can't take what's mine</p><br><p><u>Only the real can relate</u><br>Only those who have experienced true success can understand and relate to me</p><br><p><u>I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a Gate</u><br>I previously lived in public housing (the P's), but now I have a gated mansion</p><br><p><u>Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot</u><br>I had to remind these women of my power and success, in case they forgot</p><br><p><u>Another check from Mona Scott</u><br>I received another paycheck from Mona Scott (a producer of Love & Hip Hop, a TV show I was on)</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © BMG Rights Management, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Warner Chappell Music, Inc.<br>Written by: Anthony G.
