They tied the knots through&nbsp;an Italian wedding ceremony. Five years after, in March 2008, the couple welcomed their first child, a daughter Jade Marie De Laurentiis-Thompson.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Justine Schofield Wiki: Age, Married, Partner, Family | Explicit Details</a></p><p>But, 25 years of togetherness and the presence of a daughter couldn't save their marriage from crumbling down. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started</a>&nbsp;living separately in July&nbsp;2014 and filed a divorce petition in&nbsp; December 2014. The&nbsp;Italian-American chef even announced the divorce through her Facebook on December 30, 2014, and stated that the separation was an amicable decision. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The divorce settlement was one of the most expensive at the time, with her husband <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">receiving</a>&nbsp;$2 million and $9,000 a month for child support.</p><h2>She Found Love Again</h2><p>A year and a half from her divorce, in 2013, the foodie diva <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a>&nbsp;the television producer Shane Farley. She was to collaborate with him to produce a talk show. Due to that, her relationship with Farley was strictly professional at first. However, the frequent meetings sprouted a feeling between her and her partner, and the two <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">began</a>&nbsp;dating at the end of 2015.</p><p>For Laurentiis, the relationship gave her a new lease on life. After spending close to a quarter of a century with Thompson, she "felt&nbsp;like a kid again" to have a fresh start again. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Walking Down Beach: Giada De Laurentiis with daughter Jade and boyfriend Shane Farley in 2018 </strong>(Photo: PEOPLE)</p><p>Their relationship got fortified by their communal <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">love</a>&nbsp;for Italian food and the approval from Laurentiis' daughter, Jade.

It was the same scenario for&nbsp;Laurentiis. She used the quarantine time to spend her time with her boyfriend Farley in California. Moreover, she shot her latest show,&nbsp;Giada At Home 2.0,&nbsp;with help from Farley in the camera work.</p><p>While talking to the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in 2020 about her quarantine, she said that she never had a chance to spend such a long time with her partner before. The Food Network star then&nbsp;stated that the quarantine had made her bond with her boyfriend stronger.</p><p>I think it's made us stronger. Truly. I think that's what happens sometimes in these things. You either become stronger or you start to say like, 'Ah, I can't do this.' So it's been fun.</p><p>Moreover, she mentioned her daughter and said that the quarantine helped her know her daughter on a deeper level. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Laurentiis Looked Back at More Simples Times</h2><p>On 8 November 2018, Giada shared a beautiful throwback from her life as a mom with daughter Jade.&nbsp;The picture showed Giada embracing a navy tracksuit while feeding her daughter a bottle.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Beautiful Moment Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow: Giada posts an old picture of her bottle-feeding her daughter on Instagram.</strong> (Photo: Giada De Laurentiis' Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She covered the caption with her disbelief at the fact that her daughter was so small.

In fact, the chef opened up to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in March 2018 about how her daughter loved to fiddle with kitchen stuff,</p><p>I bought Jade a little purple ceramic knife and she just loves it. She's like 'What can I chop? What can I cut?' It makes her excited about what she's going to make, and then she's more apt to actually try new things and eat her dinner.</p><h2>Laurentiis' Journey To Fame</h2><p>The&nbsp;face of Food Network, Laurentiis, presents various shows on the channel.
