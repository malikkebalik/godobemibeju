Terry’s portrayer, who in the past has dealt with transphobia <a href=# rel=noopener>even among the General Hospital cast</a>, explained it better than we ever could. “This is so major for trans people, who are constantly evaluating which environments and places are safe for us, who have so many extra obstacles to navigate just to exist and move freely,” she said. “This document is so much more than an object I’ll use to finally come home to Canada. It represents vulnerability, resilience, perseverance through endless hold times and dated websites, application rejections and money orders.</p><p>“So much of the violence we are navigating as a community,” she added, “has to do with limiting our access to resources and public spaces. This passport is a beacon, and every time I see a trans person post their new passport online, I know what a win this is for that person, for us as a family.”</p><p><strong>On your way to the comments to send James your congratulations, scroll through the below photo gallery to celebrate <a href=# rel=noopener>more out-and-proud LGBTQ+ stars</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmoJ2emr%2BiuIyhpqyomamurXvNnq6sZ2dmgHeClmiamqujlrulvsBmoZqllah6tb7Ap6qgnZ6ZsrN5z5qqrKifp8Fw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
