And while the title clarifies the story’s protagonists, story beats surrounding Kellyman’s character have still not been fully revealed. However, at the start of the series, Morgenthau is seen operating in an antagonistic light.&nbsp;</p><p>Morgenthau is one of the essential members of the Flag-Smashers, the antagonist group in the series.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Malcolm Spellman, the head writer for the series, said that Kellyman was the show’s centerpiece during an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Entertainment Tonight</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She is amazing and I would argue that, to me, in a way she is the glue for this series…</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Who Are The Flag-Smashers?</h2><p>In the comics, Flag-Smasher is a character who is the exact opposite of Captain America. A man named Karl Morgenthau was an anarchist who carried on his father’s dream of world peace and viewed nationalism as the obstacle to his goal.</p><p>The character is named Flag-Smasher aptly because he made his debut destroying flags in the UN and stood against the idea of dividing the world and humanity through nationalities. And because of his ideals, he repeatedly clashed against Captain America, whom he considered the icon of “national vanity.” Flag-Smasher is also the leader of ULTIMATUM (The Underground Liberated Totally Integrated Mobile Army To Unite Mankind).</p><p>But in the&nbsp;MCU, Flag-Smasher appears to be rather different from what it was in the comics. Flag-Smasher in&nbsp;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;is a competent organization that poses an international threat. The members wear black masks with a red handprint and aim to unite the world through violence. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Kellyman’s Karli Morgenthau could be an elite member of the organization or its leader. Given how much&nbsp;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&nbsp;has already strayed from the comics, it’s not clear if Karli is just the gender-bent version of Karl Morgenthau or a completely revamped character with a unique storyline. What is certain is that Karli is an essential character in this MCU series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnFmqOcp55irq%2BwjK2fnmWnnru1sdFmqqiklJ6ys3nEq6CnZZuaua3FzJqlZqWRp8OmuIygo66dXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
