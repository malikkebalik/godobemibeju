In that Monday night win over the Bills, Whitehead intercepted Josh Allen three times.
Whitehead has only had one more interception but he has tied his career high with nine passes broken up.
“Personally, I think this league is all about production. I think this may be, and definitely coverage-wise, one of my most productive seasons,” Whitehead said this week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I think this may be, and definitely coverage-wise, one of my most productive seasons,” Whitehead said this week. “Obviously, I had the picks early with the Bills and one against the Raiders. I think I’ve had the most PBUs I’ve had in a season.”</p><p>Whitehead is scheduled to be a free agent in March.</p><p>He said he would like to return to the Jets if they are interested.</p><p>“I think about it all the time. This is my second time going through free agency,” Whitehead said. “It’s a stressful process. You’re blessed to be in the position. I love this defense. I love the guys I play with, everybody but especially in the secondary — just the communication, the chemistry we have together. This would be the spot for me. I’d love to be back with these guys. Who knows what happens with the offensive side of the ball with [Aaron Rodgers] but it would be a great thing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/congratulated-cornerback-d-j-reed-72246126.jpg><p>Coach Robert Saleh praised Whitehead.</p><p>“I feel like he’s had a good season, obviously there’s a couple of things he’ll even admit he needs to get better at, but his coverage stuff has been fantastic, it’s all been pretty much the same, if not better than a few years ago,” Saleh said. “He’s been opportunistic in getting the ball, and we have three games left, so I think he’ll continue to make plays. He’s gotten better.”</p><p>Saleh said Whitehead needed to improve his tackling at midseason and he did.</p><p>“For me, it’s all about the kill shot,” Whitehead said about his tackling. “I’m not a big guy, so when I try to put all my force into him, a lot of times I don’t use my arms to wrap up. I use my shoulders. That was the big thing. That’s always how I played. [Safeties coach Marquand Manuel] is always telling me, just get him down. I went back and we watched some tape. We watched Earl Thomas. They would hit some times, but most of the time they were getting run over bringing them down. Saleh would always say, ‘I know you don’t want to get embarrassed, but just get them down.’ That’s what I’ve been doing.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/12/speaks-media-practice-atlantic-health-72441819.jpg><p>The Jets elevated FB Nick Bawden and LB Marcelino McCrary-Ball from the practice squad for Sunday’s game. … G Laken Tomlinson was fined $21,855 for unnecessary roughness in last week’s loss to the Dolphins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtma2tfqL2wvtOsZqOnopmur3nWoaCtnZiarqV5x6innqtdqbxursRmmZqbm2LEqsDHZqGerKNirqfAxKtkrKyipLuoedKemKynnmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
