She served as the Chippendales’ bookkeeper. The 1980s saw the couple’s wedding. Irene and Steve had two kids together. She inherited the whole Chippendale family’s wealth after the passing of her husband. Annaleigh Ashford played her in the biographical drama miniseries Welcome to Chippendales.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Irene-Banerjee-1.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Relationship></span><span><strong>Relationship</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>According to Welcome to Chippendales Episode 2, Steve Banerjee’s company, Chippendales, is how he met his wife, Irene. It was assumed that the real Irene Banerjee was an accountant, just as the Irene series viewers get to know. Irene and her partner got married in the 1980s, and it’s believed that she helped him until he passed away in 1994.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Irene-Banerjee-and-Steve-Banerjee.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Parents_And_Siblings></span><span><strong>Parents And Siblings</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>According to The Cinemaholic, Irene was born to Anna and Wolodymyr Tychowskyj. She was one of five siblings. She was raised in a modest home. Regarding her birthdate and age, nothing is known. Due to breast cancer-related complications, she passed away on February 8, 2001.</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Death></span><span><strong>Death</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Just hours before being sentenced, on October 23, 1994, Steve Banerjee committed suicide in prison. As a result, the US government was unable to collect his numerous assets since they were transferred to his wife Irene, who supported him all the way to the end. After Steve Banerjee passed away, his wife Irene Banerjee inherited Chippendales and the entire company. Irene Banerjee passed away from breast cancer in February 2001, however there is sadly very little information available about her before that time. Irene sold the Chippendales name to a private owner before she passed away for $2.5 million. However, it’s unclear exactly when ownership of the business changed hands.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/latestinbollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Irene-and-steve-death.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span><span><strong>Net Worth</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>She reportedly sold Chippendales for $2.5 million in 2000, according to The Bustle.
