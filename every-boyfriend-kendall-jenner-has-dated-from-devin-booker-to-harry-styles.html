Apart from the “Rude Boy” singer, the rapper has dated other popular women like Teyana Taylor, Iggy Azalea, Chanel Iman, and Tahiry Jose.</p><p>ASPA Rocky has also been romantically linked to Rosee Divine, Rita Ora, and Madison Skylar. One of the most interesting facts about his relationship with Kendall is the fact that he was also linked to Kendall’s younger sister, Kylie Jenner, about a year before it emerged that he and Kendall were lovers.</p><p>People began paying attention to the two in May 2016 after they were seen spending time together on several occasions. By June, they were seen together in Paris and it became apparent they had something special. Although neither of them commented on what was happening between them, there was no doubt they were in a relationship as time made that obvious.</p><p>They attended multiple showbiz events together, including the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Met Gala of May 2017</a> that had them all over each other.

All through his career, he has had a busy love life which has seen celebrity gossip outlets link him to Bella Hadid, Chantel Jeffries, Chanel Iman, Hailey Bieber, Ashlee Roberson, and Karizma Ramir.</p><p>Based on what was reported in some quarters, the basketball player and Kendall Jenner had been secretly dating for months before the night they were spotted together at The Nice Guy, an intimate restaurant and lounge in West Hollywood: this was in March 2016.</p><p>Kendall and Jordan Clarkson were seen hanging out together a number of times but neither of them ever confirmed they were dating. When the basketball player was asked about what was happening between him and the model, he evaded offering a straight answer to the question.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Jordan said he prefers keeping his private life private</a> and that even if something was happening between them, no one would know. Similarly, Kendall dismissed claims about dating the NBA star. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>In a July 2019 tweet</a>, she pointed out that she had only dated two out of the multiple NBA players she has been linked to. The public concluded that the two players are Ben Simmons and Blake Griffin.</p><h3><strong>Chandler Parsons (Rumored)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name: </strong>Chandler Evan Parsons</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> October 25, 1988</li><li><strong>Age:&nbsp;</strong>35 Years Old</li><li><strong>Occupation:&nbsp;</strong>Professional Basketball Player</li><li><strong>Duration of Relationship:&nbsp;</strong>2014 – 2017</li></ul><p lang=en dir=ltr>✈️ Frankfurt bound on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">@AmericanAir</a> ???? <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/vDf85elKxN</a></p><p>— Chandler Parsons (@ChandlerParsons) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">August 14, 2015</a></p><p>Chandler Parsons is yet another professional basketball player that has been romantically linked to Kendall Jenner. The Casselberry, Florida native has played as a small forward for several NBA teams since he was selected by the Houston Rockets in 2011. The NBA star got engaged to Haylee Harrison whom he has been dating since the summer of 2019 in November 2020.</p><p>Before Haylee, he dated Cassie Amato, Tomi Garrn, Christina Perri, and Robyn Crowley. It was sometime in 2014 that the basketball player was first linked to the famous model. From what we gathered, they met through a personal trainer they shared. They began hanging out thereafter and as expected, people began speculating they were dating.</p><p>The rumors had a natural death after people stopped seeing them together in public. However, it came back to life in January 2017 when they were seen together at a Bentley dealership in Beverly Hills.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TMZ reported that they partied all over Hollywood</a> a few days after the Bentley dealership. This fueled the speculations about them being lovers but neither of the two ever confirmed or denied they were dating.

It was sometime in August 2015 that it began circulating that the singer and the model were lovers.</p><p>Celebrity gossip platforms reported that the two were encouraged to pursue a relationship by Gigi Hadid who was dating Nick’s brother, Joe Jonas. It was claimed that Gigi played cupid because she wanted to have more of her friend (Kendall) around.</p><p>Many bought the story as Kendall and Jonas had been seen together a couple of times.

Reports had it that she flew to Monaco with Gigi and Bella Hadid to cheer for the driver.</p><p>In September of that same year, the two were again seen together in New York and it fueled the speculations. It was even claimed in some quarters that sources close to them divulged that Kendall’s mother wanted her to date the British racing driver.</p><p>As typical of Kendall, she refrained from discussing the topic; so the rumors went on until Lewis dismissed the speculations. He reportedly stated that they were just friends.</p><p>The Formula One racer has been quiet about his love life of late, but it is no secret he had an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, an American singer-songwriter, from 2007 to 2015.
