Some of the comments include:&nbsp;“She’s a whole different face,” along with, “Your was prettier before all the surgeries,” and “The plastic surgery is strong with this one, and also “More like a before and after picture.” Whoa!</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>If Blac Chyna did get plastic surgery like fans are speculating, it would be pretty ironic. Seeing as though she’s engaged in a&nbsp;diss war&nbsp;with&nbsp;Kylie, which revolved around mocking her looks, Blac would have nothing to make fun of Kylizzle&nbsp;for, if she had plastic surgery herself. It’s obvious Blac isn’t a fan of Kylie for being in a relationship with her ex man, <strong>Tyga</strong>, but she’s taken her disses to an extreme level. We all remember the pic she posted of her wearing extremely huge lips&nbsp;when the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge went viral!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>[jwplatform j5c5iPjL]</p><h3>Blac Chyna Had A ‘Field Day’ Dissing Kylie Jenner’s Home During Visit</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tyga recently went behind Kylie’s back when he snuck Blac Chyna into her home, so she could check out the special room the teen built for hers and Tyga’s son,&nbsp;<strong>King Cairo</strong>, 2. However, the whole time Blac was in Kylie’s pad, she just couldn’t stop mocking Kylie’s style!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“She walked through every single room critiquing the place, mostly saying s–t like ‘that’s ugly’ and ‘this girl has no taste,’” an insider told us.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>What do YOU think,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>?
