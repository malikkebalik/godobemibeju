Four years after their divorce, Stamos said his divorce made him feel like a failure.</p><p class=dh>Years later, Stamos and his wife bought a house near Romijn and her husband's. Though he hadn't seen or talked to Romijn, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a37349067/john-stamos-rebecca-romijn-jerry-oconnell-podcast-comment/>said</a>,</p><p class=dh>"I'm happy for them. That's it.

McHugh played the role of one of the girls he was trying to fool around with and have a baby.</p><p class=dh>They met again when McHugh was in the "Fuller House" audience because her roommate was on an episode. Stamos walked in and jokingly accused her of stalking him.</p><p class=dh>Despite his age, the actor has the playfulness of a kid and has always been a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/john-stamos-talks-dating>superfan of Disneyland</a>. He even has the second original sign from Disneyland.</p><p class=dh>After their second meeting, they fell in love, and almost two years later, Stamos proposed to McHugh at Disneyland after they learned they were expecting a baby.</p><p class=dh>Before the proposal, he called her parents to ask, and they confirmed she also loves Disneyland. He made a short film of romantic moments, and the end showed Sebastian from "The Little Mermaid" and encouraging him to ask the girl.</p><p class=dh>He got down on his knee and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/BamV5xPAKJd/>proposed</a>. For McHugh, she took to her Instagram to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/tv/john-stamos-disney-themed-proposal-caitlin-mchugh/>reveal</a> that she kissed the boy and said yes. She went on to call Stamos the sweetest, most romantic Prince Charming.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>A DREAM COME TRUE</strong></p><p class=dh>On February 3, 2018, Stamos and McHugh got <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/john-stamos-caitlin-mchugh-magical-wedding-day-photos/flower-power-2/>married</a> in a romantic church service followed by an intimate reception at this luxury home.</p><p class=dh>For her big day, McHugh looked stunning and was the picture-perfect bride in a white strapless gown with a full tulle skirt. Her hair was parted on the side and held back with a jeweled hair clip.</p><p class=dh>While wearing sunglasses, Stamos opted for a dark suit with a matching bow tie. His boutonnière matched McHugh's bouquet, making them the perfect couple.</p><p class=dh>Stamos revealed that finding McHugh helped him straighten his life as he sobered up and became a better person. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/john-stamos-on-how-wife-caitlin-son-billy-changed-his-life-exclusive/>said</a>,</p><p class=dh>"I wasn't deserving of it, yet I think. But six years ago, I sobered up, and I became a better person. And when Caitlin came around, I recognized it immediately. I said, 'I have to be good for that to make it work.' "</p><p class=dh>McHugh also shared that they keep their marriage strong by relying on communication and date nights, especially now that they're parenting.</p><p class=dh>Having married in his fifties, Stamos believes that it feels right. He is grateful to have had the opportunity to be married with a kid and a family.</p><p class=dh>The actor, who recently celebrated his fourth wedding anniversary, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/john-stamos-im-so-grateful-to-be-married-have-kid-at-this-age/>believes</a> that any marriage that can make it through the pandemic has got a good shot.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FATHERHOOD WAS WHAT HE ALWAYS WANTED</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Stamos</a> had always wanted to be a father, but when he was married to Romijn, she didn't want kids, which may have contributed to their divorce.</p><p class=dh>Knowing how much he wanted kids, Stamos never thought he would meet the right person, and feeling like he had everything, Stamos didn't want to be greedy.</p><p class=dh>He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/john-stamos-fatherhood-advice-parents-79938652>thought</a> having kids wasn't going to happen for him. Stamos was grateful for the many blessings in his life and concluded that maybe having kids would not be a part of his life.</p><p class=dh>On April 16, 2018, Stamos took to his Instagram to announce the birth of his son. In his caption, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/16/john-stamos-welcomes-son-billy/>stated</a> that the best part of him would always be his wife and son, whom he named Billy Stamos after his father.</p><p class=dh>Being a father late in life, Stamos has a piece of advice for first-time parents or parents who want a child later in life. He wants to let them know that fear is normal, but that shouldn't stop anyone from becoming a parent.</p><p class=dh>However, he said it's a little harder because his son runs faster than him, but it's the greatest thing in his life, and he's so happy he did it.</p><p class=dh>The couple hopes and plans to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/john-stamos-opens-up-about-wife-caitlin-and-hopes-for-second-child-exclusive/>expand</a> their family. However, they revealed that they had been trying for a while without success.</p><p class=dh>Irrespective of what happens, Stamos says he's trying to be very present for every moment with his son. He wants to be alive to see all of the wonderful things in his son's life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtvb2piZ3qru8enZKyskaK8tHnIrGSnp6ditaK8z6KjsmWdlr%2BztcSdZLChlpp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
