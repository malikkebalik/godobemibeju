Her legacy lives on through the countless lives she touched and the love she shared.</p><p>To honor Margaret’s memory and her enduring spirit, a service and cremation will be held on Friday, November 10th, at 2:00 pm in the Blackley Crematorium center chapel.

In lieu of sending flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made to “The Macmillan Care team.” This choice reflects Margaret’s compassionate nature and her commitment to helping others in their time of need. Your contributions will make a meaningful difference in the lives of those battling illness and seeking care.</p><p>For any additional information or inquiries regarding the service, please reach out to Michael Kennedy personally at Greater Manchester Funeral Service in Moston.
