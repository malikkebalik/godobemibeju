You didn’t call none of those people, you just did it at home?'”</p><p>“No, I called a couple of people that she gave me,” Cardi B admitted, but didn’t dive into detail.</p><p>The Post has attempted to reach Kardashian’s camp for comment on or confirmation of Cardi B’s claims.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Cardi B admitted to phoning some of Kim Kardashian’s plastic surgeon recommendations.</figure><p>The iconic television family is steadfast in their denial of extreme plastic surgery –&nbsp;although before and after snaps say otherwise. Just last year <a href=#>Kardashian appeared on the cover of Allure</a>, only admitting to receiving minor Botox between her perfectly plucked brows.</p><p>Yet, she denied ever receiving fillers, extensions or “anything” — something the “Bodak Yellow” rapper inadvertently dished is a lie.</p><p>“I’ve never had eyelash extensions. I’ve never done anything,” Kardashian previously told Allure. “I’ve never filled my cheeks. I’ve never filled my lips.”</p><p>The 41-year-old mogul, who owns her own skincare line, admitted to being beauty obsessed, caring about her appearance “more than 90% of the people on this planet.”</p><p>While her vanity is the crux of her empire, these fleeting references to her beauty regimen ignited controversy online. Multiple critics flamed the interviewer for not pressing Kardashian further than on her Botox use.</p><p>The reality star’s curves put her on the pop culture map, as fans clamored to <a href=#>achieve her same “slim thick” figure</a> –&nbsp;which apparently is all a <a href=#>plastic mirage</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Cardi B <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">stunned in 2019</a> after admitting she’d had two cosmetic surgeries to slim down and perk up following the birth of her daughter, Kulture. <span class=credit>Redferns</span></figure><p>“The slim-thick ideal was most harmful to women’s appearance, weight and overall body satisfaction,” <a href=#>stated authors of a previous York University study</a>, which analyzed Kardashian’s unhealthy influence on young, impressionable women. “[It] may still represent an ideal of beauty that women find threatening and personally unattainable.”</p><p>But <a href=#>following a bout with extreme weight loss </a>to squeeze into Marilyn Monroe’s glittering dress at last year’s Met Gala, Kardashian bid her infamous hourglass goodbye. In addition to touting a restrictive diet, Kardashian <a href=#>is under scrutiny for potentially reversing her BBL</a> and <a href=#>allegedly using Ozempic</a>, a weight loss drug <a href=#>made for people with diabetes</a>.</p><p>With all the lasering, tightening and injecting, it’s a surprise the famous family <a href=#>continues to use Photoshop</a>. Kardashian has gone so far as to supposedly <a href=#>edit her neck to be slimmer</a> and<a href=#> make her legs thinner</a>.</p><p>“I was kind of joking, but now that I think about it, I would probably eat s – – t if someone told me, ‘If you eat this bowl of poop every single day, you’ll look younger,’” she previously joked <a href=#>in an interview with the New York Times</a>, although she supposedly knows where to draw the line. “I’m 41. I always want to look appropriate. There does come a point when you’ve taken it too far — overfilled, too tight, too much cosmetic work. There’s nothing worse.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Kim Kardashian has become the poster child of the “slim-thick” ideal, according to NYU researchers, who called the trend “harmful.” <span class=credit>@kimkardashian/Instagram</span></figure><p>Despite admitting she’s alright with not being “perfect,” it might be high time for Kardashian to take a page out of her own book.</p><p>“I hate my hands — they’re wrinkly and gross,” Kardashian told Allure. “But I’ve lived life and I’ve changed so many diapers with these hands and I’ve snuggled my babies with these hands, so I’m okay with them. [Getting older] doesn’t mean that I won’t strive for perfection, but you get to a point where you’re like, ‘Okay, my health is more important than anything else.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmanBfmK6zsMhmmWajmaJ6rK3RnZisoJmWu26zwK%2BcZqWVYr2trdKtoJxlo6q%2FqLHRsmSanKaesKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
