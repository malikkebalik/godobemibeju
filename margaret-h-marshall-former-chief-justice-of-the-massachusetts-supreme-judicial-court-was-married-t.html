Previously on <i>April 11, 2001</i>, the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD)&nbsp;had already filed the case on behalf of the plaintiff couple. Still, the jurisdiction decision was in favor of the Massachusetts Department of Health, misguided by prejudice.</p><p>The Court's decision was adjourned on November 18, 2003, with a vote of 4-3, the majority opinion-making it unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the rights and privileges associated with marriage. Margaret wrote the majority opinion in the landmark case, <i>Goodridge v.
