big guy,” <a href=#>Biden snapped</a>: “Why do you ask such a dumb question?”</p><p>The unclassified FD-1023 form revealed a confidential human source paid by the bureau spoke with Zlochevsky about the president and his son accepting $10 million in bribes from the Burisma owner.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The president has repeatedly told

father oversaw US policy on Ukraine as vice president in the Obama White House, and he served in the position until 2019, earning up to $1 million annually.</p><p>House Republicans on Thursday began their impeachment inquiry against the president over allegations that he may have profited from lucrative business arrangements James and Hunter Biden had with foreign nationals.</p><p>House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) subpoenaed bank records showing the Biden family received <a href=#>more than $24 million</a> from entities in Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Romania and China between 2014 and 2019.</p><p>Hunter and James Biden <a href=#>netted $4.8 million</a> alone from a deal with the Chinese energy firm CEFC in 2017.</p><p>The amount was independently confirmed by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a Senate Republican report</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Washington Post</a> and began to flow to their accounts just 10 days after Hunter threatened one of their associates by invoking his father.</p><p>“I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled,” Hunter Biden wrote to a translator for the firm, Raymond Zhao, on July 30 of that year.</p><p>He added that he would “make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction.”</p><p>The Post’s bombshell October 2020 report also found emails on the first son’s abandoned laptop that <a href=#>show Hunter would hold a 10% stake</a> in CEFC “for the big guy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 2017 exchange on WhatsApp was uncovered by IRS tax investigators during their five-year probe of the first son’s finances.</p><p>The House Ways and Means Committee has released hundreds of documents from two whistleblowers tasked with the case, who alleged that the Justice Department interfered in their investigation.</p><p>Comer also revealed Tuesday that the president’s Wilmington, Del., residence was also the beneficiary address for <a href=#>two wire transfers totaling $260,000</a> that a Chinese government-backed investment firm, BHR Partners, sent to Hunter Biden in July and August 2019.</p><p>The first son disclosed in federal court filings earlier this year that he was living in California in summer 2019 while preparing to write his memoir, though he spent time at his father’s Delaware mansion in 2017 and 2018 following his divorce from wife Kathleen Buhle.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image

shares and the president’s Delaware address was “his only permanent address at the time.”</p><p>He also said Hunter wasn’t in business with his father and that any discussions between the president and his son in the presence of business associates would have been “small talk.”</p><p>White House counsel spokesman Ian Sams has dismissed the impeachment inquiry into the president, saying Republicans had “no evidence of wrongdoing” and were using “discredited personal attacks on him and his family.”</p><p>Not all of James’ ventures succeeded.</p><p>One sought to build 100,000 homes in Iraq with a $1.5 billion potential contract while Joe Biden as vice president oversaw US policy toward the nation in 2010.</p><p>The first brother was called in by the construction firm Hill International to serve as executive vice president of a joint venture, HillStone International, that would build low-cost houses in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.</p><p>The venture touted James Biden’s work for his brother’s successful 1972 campaign for the US Senate in Delaware, and the former president of Hill International said, “Jim was very good at getting meetings set up and getting people to return his phone calls.”</p><p>But construction never got started and the firm ended operations by taking a $1 million charge.</p><p>“If the question is, ‘What did Jim Biden accomplish for us?,'” ex-Hill International president David Richter told the Journal, “the answer is nothing.”</p><p class=postsid
