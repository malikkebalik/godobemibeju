He also contributed as a writer of the show, and served as The Joke Man, but finally left the show in 2001.&nbsp; Jackie has also been involved in other writing and radio activities, which have undoubtedly boosted Jackie Martling’s net worth.</p><p>So just how rich is Jackie Martling? Sources estimate that Jackie’s net worth is as high as $2 million, virtually all accumulated during his 30 years in radio broadcasting..</p><h3>Jackie Martling Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>Jackie Martling graduated from Michigan State University in 1971 with a degree in mechanical engineering. Jackie then spent some time living on Long Island, mostly focusing on the entertainment industry, and this was where his career began. Martling actually started his career as a singer, but Jackie’s net worth really started growing when he joined The Off Hour Rockers, a famous comedy group. Following this success, he left the group in the late 1970s and started a solo career performing&nbsp; in comedy, working hard as a stand-up comedian, and adding considerably to his net worth. Two years later, Jackie decided to expand his career and started performing on radio, firstly appearing on the Rick Dees morning show. This role not only increased Jackie Martling’s net worth but also boosted the popularity of the <a href=#>Rick Dees</a> show. As mentioned, Jackie is best known for The <a href=#>Howard Stern</a> Show, which attracted many people because of one part of the show named Stump the Joke Man. There was a game during this segment when somebody from the audience had to guess a phrase which the comedian could not say, and thus, to stump the comedian. Winners from the listening audience received a T-shirt.</p><p>Over the years Jackie Martling has been considered to be one of the best comedians. A few comedy albums were released entitled Normal People Are People You Don`t Know That Well, Goin` Ape, and What Did You Expect. All these productions greatly increased revenues to Jackie Martling’s net worth. Moreover, Martling has released a DVD, several videos, a couple of joke books and, surprisingly, an iPhone app. Jackie also appeared on the TV show “Leverage” for some time, which helped him to gross more money.</p><p>Jackie’s film industry credits include “The Aristocrats”, and he has appeared playing small roles in many films, including “Jokebitch” in 2005 for which he won the Best Supporting Actor Award from New York International Independent Film & Video Festival. However, Jackie Martling has never abandoned hosting radio shows, and in 2006 became the host of “Jackie`s Joke Hunt”,. which aired virtually continuously until the final episode in November 2014.&nbsp; In 2007 Martling made a guest appearance on Stern’s SiriusXM show, and has since made additional guest appearances, both in the studio and by ‘phone, as well as participating in several other radio shows.</p><p>In his personal life, Jackie Martling was married to Nancy Sirianni, but they divorced in 2013.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=12.295025728988><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jackie Martling</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$2 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 14, 1948</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Profession</td><td>Screenwriter, Comedian, Film producer, Radio writer, Actor, Songwriter, Radio personality</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Oyster Bay High School, Michigan State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Nancy Sirianni</td></tr><tr readability=0.31818181818182><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/jackiemartling</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0554241</a></td></tr><tr readability=13><td>Movies</td><td>The Great Fight, Venus & Vegas, Kiss Me Again, Mail Order Bride, High Times' Potluck, Ghoul School, Comedy's Dirtiest Dozen, My Cross To Bear, Jackie The Joke Man Martling: A Safe Distance From Genius, Open Mic</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks readability=1><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>High-pitched laugh</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2</td><td>His act is non-stop rapid-fire dirty jokes</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=7.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=6><td>1</td><td>Is a songwriter as well as a comedian.
