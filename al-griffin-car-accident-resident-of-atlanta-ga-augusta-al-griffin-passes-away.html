Al Gryphon, better known to many as James Allen Gryphon Jr., has been identified as the victim. Al Gryphon, a citizen of Atlanta, Georgia, reportedly died as a result of injuries he received in a traffic accident early in the morning.</p><p>James Allen Gryphon Jr., 42, was reportedly driving on Interstate 520 early on Sunday morning when his vehicle apparently off the lane and rolled many times after leaving the roadway, according to Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen’s findings.</p><p>According to his Facebook profile, Al Gryphon was born in Augusta, Georgia, and raised in Atlanta, Georgia. From Lucy Craft Laney High School, he graduated. Al continued his education at Denmark Technical College to study mechanical engineering after high school. At Atlanta Ironworkers Union Local 387, he was employed.</p><p>Al was an inspiration to all of us; he personified what it is to be a beautiful person. He was incredibly nice and had a comforting presence that melted many people’s hearts. He set an example for everyone who was lucky enough to know him.</p><p>That a man is just now realising this is impossible. Al Gryphon, you and I were more than simply 00 classmates—we were like family. Our laughs and smiles from Hoco will never be replaced. This one hurts—truly, really hurts. This one has broken my heart.</p><p>There have been reports that Gryphon was thrown out of the car. He was transported by emergency medical services to Doctors Hospital in order to obtain treatment there. When it was discovered that Gryphon had died, it was around 2:53 in the afternoon. This body is going to undergo an autopsy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigkarAorrEsGWcp51ju6h7wKVkoKqZm7OquoycmKtlkZiwqrDEp6tmqpWotqWxza1kqJ5dlsGtrc2tmGafkWKutrPUrKuaZZGheqi%2ByJ%2BdoqZdpa60v8SsZJqvka58</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
