RIP.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the clip, Jason takes an electric razor to his face while standing in the desert. With every piece of hair that came off his perfectly sculpted chin, Jason said goodbye to each of his iconic roles (Drogo, Aquaman, Declan Harp, and Baba Voss). But this end of an era didn‚Äôt come without reason. The&nbsp;Justice League star decided to get rid of his beard to ‚Äúmake a positive change for the health of our planet.‚Äù Jason used the video to raise awareness about the harms of plastic while supporting a new range of water sold in aluminum cans that are ‚Äú100% recyclable.‚Äù</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After images of a clean-shaven Jason Momoa hit the Internet, fans flocked to Twitter to express a wide range of emotions over his new look. Some were supportive of the change, like <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@oneunity</a> who thought the Aquaman star was helping the world in more than one way. ‚ÄúRespect to Jason Momoa, who‚Äôs just shaved his beard off (to encourage people to stop using plastic bottles) and simultaneously revealed a jaw line that might just save the whole planet,‚Äù the user tweeted.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jason Momoa is FIINNE with or without the beard.
