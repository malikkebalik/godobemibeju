It has been reported by authoritative sources that the overall size of her wealth is as much as $7 billion, as of the data presented in the middle of 2017. The foundation of her wealth is her inheritance of 35% of her father’s fortune – he had founded Carnival Cruise Lines in 1972, which was the name of Carnival Corporation plc, the largest cruise company in the world.
