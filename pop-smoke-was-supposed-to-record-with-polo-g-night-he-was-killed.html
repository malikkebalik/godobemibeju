Let’s do something.’”</p><p>He added: “The craziest thing, I worked with him right before he passed. I was in the studio with him.

Any time we were around each other, it’s a lot of energy where you’re just dancing and having fun. Never any negative vibes, and it was the same thing this night.”</p><p>He continued: “We was in the studio, it was a late night. It was a couple of people, a couple of girls. Everybody is just laughing and having fun. He was playing music, and then I did a verse and he did some other songs.
