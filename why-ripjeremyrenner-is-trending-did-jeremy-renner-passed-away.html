A significant portion of the movementâ€™s supporters demand accountability for Rennerâ€™s actions towards his ex-wife, Sonni Pacheco.</p><p>The couple divorced in 2014, citing irreconcilable differences. Pacheco later alleged that Renner had threatened to kill her and had displayed disturbing behavior, including threatening suicide and firing a gun into the ceiling to intimidate her.</p><p>Further allegations include Renner being under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and biting his young daughter Ava. Pacheco also claimed that Renner left cocaine within reach of their daughter. These allegations have led to a call for a thorough examination of Rennerâ€™s behavior.</p><p><strong>Some fake tweets about Jeremy Rennerâ€™s death:</strong></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeremy Renner was an inspiration to me to continue acting and treating loved ones (especially spouse) with the kindness and respect they need.. an empathetic and kind man had descended from this world yesterdayâ€¦ <a href=#>#RIPjeremyrenner</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/peyR1DKFxg</a></p>â€” Financially Successful Person (@dickpussygirl) <a href=#>June 23, 2023</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>people are mourning the loss of our favorite actor â€¦ love when the community comes together â€¦ <a href=#>#RIPJeremyRenner</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/bVyI2LRHN0</a></p>â€” pudding person (@JUNlPER) <a href=#>June 23, 2023</a><p lang=en dir=ltr>RIP Jeremy Renner, can't believe you got shredded to pieces in a freak escalator accident, at least he went out the way he always wanted to ðŸ˜” <a href=#>#RIPJeremyRenner</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/CpM3VITLPP</a></p>â€” KQ (@KQsAlt) <a href=#>June 23, 2023</a><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=renners-public-image-and-the-impact-on-his-career>Rennerâ€™s Public Image and the Impact on His Career</h2><p>The movement also focuses on Rennerâ€™s public image, highlighting instances where he used derogatory language against trans people and racial slurs.</p><p>His conduct during interviews, including calling Black Widow, a fellow Avenger, a slut, has been criticized. These actions, while not as severe as the allegations related to his family, have contributed to the negative perception of the actor.</p><p>The question now is whether the #RIPJeremyRenner movement will lead to Renner being ostracized from mainstream entertainment, similar to what happened to Gina Carano. The future of Rennerâ€™s career, including his role in the upcoming Hawkeye series on Disney+, remains uncertain.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=the-death-hoax>The Death Hoax</h2><p>Adding to the confusion, a hoax news story circulated on social media claiming that Renner had been killed in an escalator accident.</p><p>This is not the first time such a hoax has been spread about the actor; a similar incident occurred in 2017. Despite the lack of any credible source, the news went viral, leading to the trending of #RIPJeremyRenner. However, it has been confirmed that Renner is alive and well.</p><p>In conclusion, the #RIPJeremyRenner trend does not indicate the actorâ€™s death but rather a call for accountability for his alleged actions and a critique of his public behavior. The impact of this movement on Rennerâ€™s career remains to be seen.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilqam1qMXAmqVnm5%2BifLi02Gapoqiamr%2BmudirnKemlad6qr%2BMrameppSeu6h5w6KbZqKVp7KuxYyrnKemlad6sa3SrJydZZGsrrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
