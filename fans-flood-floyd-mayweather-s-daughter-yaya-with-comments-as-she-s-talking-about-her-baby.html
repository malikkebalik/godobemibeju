She stated that he only cries when he is hungry and added that while the boy loves her and her parents, he is not very accommodating toward anyone else.</p><p class=dh>As far as when people will catch their first glimpse of him, the proud mother stated that she would consider sharing shots of him when he clocked one— this she says is to protect him from social media and the hate it can spread.</p><p class=dh>Mayweather does not want to expose her son to any of the negative aspects of social media — a wise decision given the way netizens reacted to the footage.</p><p class=dh>One fan described the 19-year-old as a "toddler" while another asked why she carries herself "like a 15-year-old." A third user who had gotten enough of the malicious comments rose to the young mother's defense.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Mayweather's father has been bestowing favor upon his grandson since he was born.</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/564e662882eb7c11f81b2b69d982d4a6.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A fan's reaction to Yaya Mayweather talking about her newborn baby on Instagram Live | Source: Instagram.com/theshaderoom</p><p class=dh>She pointed out Mayweather's age and declared that it "takes time to grow out of your childlike mind." The woman further added that they leave her to be since the frontal lobe that aids critical thinking does not develop fully until age 24.</p><p class=dh>Mayweather is only one of four kids the famous boxer has with two different women, but she is the only one who has given birth. She made no official announcements about the delivery, but she shared a video clip that saw her holding a newborn earlier in January.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/ce7e91d259997b040573ee7b132d5fbd.png><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>A fan's reaction to Yaya Mayweather talking about her newborn baby on Instagram Live | Photo: Instagram.com/theshaderoom</p><p class=dh>The boy is reportedly named after his father Kentrell Gaulden, aka NBA Youngboy, who has said nothing about the birth— he is reportedly off all social media channels at the moment.</p><p class=dh>Mayweather's father has been <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/floyd-mayweather-grandkids>bestowing favor,</a> in the form of gifts, upon his grandson since he was born.

Hopefully, the two have ironed things out and learned their lessons— never play with knives, among others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttamlhanqnrc2sZJ%2Bkn6Sxbq%2FOpqSepqSoerSxxKKloGWWoby6sIymmLKvlZbBb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
