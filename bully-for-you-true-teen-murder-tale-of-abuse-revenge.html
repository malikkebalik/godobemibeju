 Like the disturbing, NC-17 rated “Kids,” about a group of Manhattan teens involved in drug use and unprotected sex, “Bully” is another raw, unflinching look at the teen milieu."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So many films are homogenized and sanitized and Hollywood-ized, but this is trying to get that feeling of what it’s really like to go through something like this.”</p><p>Production on “Bully” – which stars Brad Renfro, Rachel Miner and Bijou Phillips, and features Clark in a cameo role – was postponed for 10 months after the Columbine shootings, but the film arrives in theaters at a time when the sometimes lethal results of school bullying are still a hot-button topic.</p><p>Based on the book “Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge,” by Jim Schutze, the film examines the events before and after the vicious murder, for which the middle-class, suburban killers received sentences from seven years in prison to the death penalty.</p><p>“It was almost like Marty was the victim of spousal abuse, where the abused partner can’t seem to get away. It’s that old question: Why can’t you walk away? Why did you have to kill him?” Clark says.</p><p>“It’s complicated. I think that your sympathy is with the other kids until [the killing], and then you realize what a horrible thing it is.</p><p>“Bullying is part of life, but it’s good to have the dialogue. It’s good to have this thing examined and understood.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXJ7j3Bmamhfl8KtuNhmnaiqXa68tnnTq6yeZaSasq95zK6pnZ2iYsGiuMRmpp9lkZfCtLGMq5yvnZ6csnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
