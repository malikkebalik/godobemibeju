Although she and former husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Vili Fualaau</a> had legally separated, the 58-year-old Letourneau decided to leave her estate to him and their two daughters, Georgia and Audrey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She loved Vili to the end," says a source close to the former teacher. "She had built a life with him, and he deserved to inherit what little she had."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He got the photos, the memories, a lot of sentimental things," the source continues. "They didn't have a ton of money, but he and the girls are going to divvy that up. They're more interested in the sentimental things, though."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Letourneau was a sixth-grade teacher in 1996 when she began sexually abusing Fualaau, who was her 12-year-old student. Ultimately, she was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for child rape. She twice became pregnant by Fualaau before he was 15, despite court orders aimed at keeping them apart.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Vili Fualaau (left) and Mary Kay Letourneau.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Splash News Online</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By the time she was released from prison, Fualaau was an adult — and he petitioned the court to allow them to see each other. A restraining order against Letourneau was dropped, but Letourneau remained a registered sex offender in Washington state until her death.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Vili Fualaau, Mary Kay Letourneau and daughters.</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple married in 2005, despite the criminal history of their relationship. They settled in Washington and raised their daughters. It lasted until 2017, when Fualaau <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>filed for legal separation</a> from his former wife.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>AP Photo/Seattle Post-Intelligencer.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Seattle Post-Intelligencer/AP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the time, Letourneau was represented by <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">David Gehrke</a>, a high-profile attorney who got to know the couple well — and kept in touch with them for more than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noreferrer>two decades</a>. "I'm not surprised that they got married," Gehrke told PEOPLE in 2017, "and I'm not surprised, in this day and age, that they are separating."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the split proceeded, Letourneau and Fualaau <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>still lived together</a> and were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=noreferrer>occasionally spotted out</a> in the Seattle area. They both remained active in the lives of their daughters, who are now grown.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Mary Kay Letourneau, Vili Fualaau and daughters.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Heidi Gutman/ABC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>joint statement</a> after Letourneau's death, the Fualaaus and Letourneaus said they were "deeply saddened" about the loss. They added that Letourneau died "peacefully" after a six-month battle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But now, the insider tells PEOPLE, there will be no controversy over Letourneau's estate. "No one is going to fight over what she had," the source says. "They are all still mourning her death, and the family has drawn very close together. And now everyone is going to be able to move forward."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>If you or someone you know has been a victim of sexual abuse, text "STRENGTH" to the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 to be connected to a certified crisis counselor.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Ontq6xjqaYq7FdoK66ecueq6itoqOyosGMpZyfrF2dsrN5xKyrmqyVYsGweceeqWadqGK1tr%2FBmqWdZaaeuap5xa6YpZmRqnqiusNmq6Gdmad6tcPOZpuarZedwaa%2B0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
