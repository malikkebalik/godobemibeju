If you are a fan of the singing sensation’s body, then you are in for a treat. We are telling you some amazing fitness tips shared by her fitness trainer Amy Rosoff Davis that will be handy for achieving your fitness goals if you implement them in your life.</p><h3><strong>Work on Your Stamina</strong></h3><p>The first crucial tip shared by the personal trainer is that you must do interval and circuit training to get in shape every day. You must also focus on building a strong core. The trainer teaches all of her clients some toning mixed with stretching and cardio exercises, reports <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TheSpec</a>. If you switch up the exercises on a daily basis, your muscles would stay on their toes and work harder as they won’t know which exercise is coming up next. Cardio and toning are awesome tools for building your stamina.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-with-trainer.jpg><h3><strong>Balance It Out</strong></h3><p>Another vital tip is to listen to your body. You must do only those exercises&nbsp;that your body can bear. When your body is up for a challenge, hit it hard in the gym but when you don’t feel like working out hard, doing some <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>yoga</a> and stretching exercises is enough. No matter which option you choose on which day, the aim should be to maintain the balance between the two. We think it means you need to spend almost equal time in relaxing and hardcore exercises. You cannot say that your body doesn’t want you to work hard every day as this will make you fail in achieving your fitness goals.</p><h3><strong>Enjoy the Exercises</strong></h3><p>Choosing the exercises you love would make workout fun for you. Gomez loves arm dancing, yoga, and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pilates</a>. You can also choose the exercises you love to keep yourself motivated to work hard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-in-white-corset-dress-wearing-silver-cuffs-during-Revival-Tour-August-2016.jpg><h3><strong>Mix it Up</strong></h3><p>Mixing your workout is probably the most common advice shared by the celebrity trainers. It is a wise advice because if you keep doing the same workout routine, you would get bored and start finding reasons to skip the workout sessions. Remember that workouts must be a vital part of your lifestyle, not a compulsion. You must also remember to try every exercise and go for a new one almost every day.</p><p>The celebrity trainer keeps it fresh for Selena by doing everything from hiking to Pilates and yoga to spinning and even circuit training. The list is endless. You can also take your pick and try new exercises constantly.</p><h3><strong>Stretching Cannot be Skipped</strong></h3><p>No matter which exercise you are doing, Amy stresses on the fact that you cannot skip stretching. It is good for keeping your muscles lean and long, it helps your joints, it is awesome for enhancing your performance and allows your muscles to work at the best capability. Stretching also makes you feel really good from the inside.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-trainer-Amy-Rosoff-Davis.jpg><h3><strong>Fitness and Happiness</strong></h3><p>The Lifestyle Guru firmly believes that if you keep fit, eat healthy meals and love yourself, you will feel good. When you start feeling good physically, you would not want to eat unhealthy foods anymore. When you take care of your health, you feel happy and this happiness gives you better results. So in order to stay happy, opting for a healthy lifestyle is a must.</p><h3><strong>No Weighing Games</strong></h3><p>Many people have the habit of weighing themselves and Davis thinks it’s a bad idea. When you weigh yourself, you give way to obsessive thoughts and behaviors. If you are working out regularly, eating healthy and having a healthy mind, soul, and body, the results would come even without the weighing scales.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-during-Revival-Tour-in-Sydney-in-August-2016.jpg><p>If you really need to measure your progress, you can do it by trying the jean test. The better your pants fit your body, the better shape you are in.</p><h3><strong>Amy’s Workout Routine on Revival Tour</strong></h3><p>The fitness guru also shared her own workout routine on the Revival Tour. She changes her workout daily but never forgets to do yoga and stretching. She spends at least 30 minutes in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>cardio</a> which she does at least 4 to 6 times every week. She also aims for doing toning and stretching 6 days a week. Apart from a workout routine, she also likes to stay active all the times. She also works out with her clients which keeps her fit. Some people even joke that she walks and moves faster than any other person on the tour as she is often speeding around through the venue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-Cosmopolitan-Philippines-August-2016-Issue.jpg><h3><strong>Don’t be Too Harsh</strong></h3><p>If your schedule is not allowing you to work out for 30 minutes, do it for 20 minutes. You must be flexible with your workouts and never be obsessed about it because obsession would get you no results. Do not put pressure on yourself to stick to any particular workout routine. Just try to be very active in general so that if you can’t workout, you still stay in shape.</p><h3><strong>Music and Workouts</strong></h3><p>Music motivates a person to workout and the nutritionist is not so different. Her current workout playlist includes:</p><ul><li>Don’t Let Me Down by The Chainsmokers</li><li>It Is What It Is by Blood Orange</li><li>This Is What You Came For’ by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Calvin Harris</a></li><li>Cheap Thrills’ by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Sia</a></li><li>Controlla by <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Drake</a></li><li>Past Lives’ by Borns</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Selena-Gomez-trainer-Amy-Rosoff-Davis-1.jpg><h3><strong>Diet Tips</strong></h3><p>If you wish to live a healthier life, the skilled chef requests you to include the following 10 items in your diet, reports <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>Elite Daily</a>.
