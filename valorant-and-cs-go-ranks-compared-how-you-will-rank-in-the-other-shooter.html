Well, it’s been a long time since Valorant came out and the game seems to have settled down comfortably, while CS:GO is firmly holding its ground.Despite the two sports having slightly different ranking systems and classification methods, there is a pattern that emerges when rank distribution data across the 2 titles is collected and compared. This gives us a rough idea of ​​what your CS:GO or Valorant rank could turn into when you move to another shooter.<span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-646 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2 id=h-comparing-valorant-and-cs-go-ranks><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-869 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><strong>Comparing Valorant and CS:GO Ranks</strong> :</h2><p>Of course, there are many other factors that will affect your Rank result when tested practically, as both titles are 2 completely different games despite sharing a lot of common features. But this data-driven concept helps us derive a direct rank conversion metric, which would theoretically be more accurate on a wider scale. So let’s see how your CS:GO or Valorant rank holds up on the other when you switch titles.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Also read <a href=#>What is Tier 1 Shipment in Modern Warfare 2?</a></p><p>CS:GO has had 18 different ranks since its inception, while Valorant currently has 22 different levels. Despite the uneven ranking distribution, there is a way to directly change your rank in CS: GO or Valorant to the rank of another shooter. For this, we will take into account the data collected by Esports Tales for February 2021 across both the titles.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportslumo.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.sportslumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30105024/2508046B-3F61-4286-B715-817A7891-1024x576.jpg></p><p>Valorant Rank Distribution – February 2021 | A quick look at the Valorant ranking distribution from Esports Tales February 2021 shows us that the maximum number of players are in the ‘Silver 1’ bracket. Only 0.1% of the total player base has achieved the ‘Radiant’ ranking. On the other hand, the CS:GO ranking distribution from February 2021 shows that the ‘Gold Nova II’ bracket has the maximum number of players. While its highest rank ‘The Global Elite’ comprises 0.78% of the total player base.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportslumo.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.sportslumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30105124/762FF3CE-29C5-4DB4-8367-161BCA82-1024x576.jpg></p><p>Now, taking into account all the ranks and their respective players’ percentages, we get a theoretical rank conversion datasheet. You can apply this directly to your current rank in CS:GO or Valorant to check your converted rank in other shooters.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sportslumo.com/ezoimgfmt/cdn.sportslumo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/30105318/4BE1827D-C1D8-428A-83B0-2E06065968A7-1024x576.jpg></p><p>Here are some things to note from the above combined data sheet :</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><ul><li>A ‘Silver 1’ player in CS:GO is most likely to be an ‘Iron 2’ player in Valorant.</li><li>A ‘Silver 2’ CS:GO player is better than an ‘Iron 3’ Valorant player but still no where close to being a ‘Bronze 1’.</li><li>A ‘Gold Nova 3’ CS:GO player is equivalent to a ‘Gold 2’ Valorant player. Also, both are the average rank for each title.</li><li>An ‘Eminent Master Guardian’ player from CS:GO and a ‘Diamond 1’ from Valorant will be in the top 10% of the total player base.</li></ul><p>However, one very important thing to note here is that Valorant’s ranking system is region-locked. This means that a player’s rank is localized to their own region, whereas when it comes to CS:GO the ranking is compared to a global player base. This can make a significant difference, despite the fact that players usually play both of these games on their own regional servers.</p><p>Get the latest article about esports from Sportslumo.com by following us on&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2Ftb%2FLrqSoZpOkunCx0qmmq6yjZMOiuM6rmKesXZa7pXnCrJ6oZaKWu6y%2FjJympqiRp7Kleceormaxn6p6uLXLpWSrmZ6geqq6jK2fnmWfqbWmvoysn6inpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
