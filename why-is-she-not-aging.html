Sofia Vergara is undoubtedly one of the most attractive women in Hollywood.

She is stunning and she is talented as well but many of her fans opened up to her in the first place because they were enchanted by her beauty, not because they loved her <a href=#><strong>acting</strong></a>. She developed the image of being a bombshell as soon as she began her career in the glamor world. She still pretty much looks the same way in that she does not look as old as she was supposed to.</p><p>The <a href=#><strong>television personality</strong></a> does not appear to have aged. Not that fans are complaining but they are interested to know if she had plastic surgery to aid her with her aging because she looks unnatural. Gorgeous but not like when she was young. Of course, it could be aging but where are the wrinkles? Let's discuss Sofia Vergara's plastic surgery!</p><p>There are more <strong><a href=#>plastic surgery</a></strong> stories of <a href=#><strong>Anitta</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Julia Fox's BBl</strong></a> that you might like.</p><h2>Sofia Vergara's Plastic Surgery: Fans Suspect She Has Had Botox, Fillers, and More!</h2><p><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@sofiavergara</a>) allegedly had plastic surgery which has aided her in fighting the effects of aging. She is suspected of having <strong>Botox</strong>, a <strong>nose job</strong>, <strong>fillers</strong>, and a <strong>facelift</strong>.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/sofia-vergara-pic1.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara is believed to have had plastic surgery to retain her youth. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Sofia Vergara is believed to have had plastic surgery to retain her youth.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Variety</strong></p><p>Her face seems to have changed (not aged) and her followers do not hesitate to bring up her appearance and draw attention to how she does not look young per se but not as old as her age either. Sofia Vergara has never liked it when people do that. In 2018, when a fan made a comment on her Instagram picture (implying that she had plastic surgery), writing that they had noticed that <a href=# rel=noopener>she had done something to her face</a> and that her face looked a little different in recent pictures, she responded with just three words, "It's called aging."</p><p>But is it aging really? The America's Got Talent judge does not seem to have aged normally. Now, she does not look young but she does not look her age either. She has a wrinkleless face and very smooth skin. It looks as though the lines on her face have been blurred out in her pictures with some filter. Her face has lost the youthful softness and it has to be because of plastic surgery is what many of her fans believe.</p><p>As for the opinions of the experts, according to <strong>Dr. Vartan Mardirossian</strong> (he has not worked with her), Sofia Vergara supposedly had a nose job before she became famous. In an interview with <a href=# rel=noopener>Closer Weekly</a>, he also suggested that she might have had Botox and fillers in her cheeks and lips to help with aging. (That's not technically plastic surgery but whatever, it counts.)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/sofia-vergara-pic2.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara is suspected of having Botox, a nose job, fillers, and a facelift. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Sofia Vergara is suspected of having Botox, a nose job, fillers, and a facelift.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Page Six</strong></p><p><strong>Jennifer Leebow</strong>, ARNP and National Education Director at LABB thinks the same. In an exclusive with <a href=# rel=noopener>Life & Style</a>, she noted that the Modern Family star's cheekbones appear to have been injected with a hyaluronic acid filler such as Voluma or Restylane Lyft to accentuate the contour of her upper face and to smooth and lift the lower part of the face. She also noted that Sofia's nasal labial folds and pre-jowl sulcus look smooth which she seemed to believe is because she contoured her upper face and injected minimal HA's into nasial labial folds. That supposedly created natural line refinement and smoothing which is why Sofia looks not old.</p><h2>Sofia Vergara on Plastic Surgery!</h2><p>Most of the experts seem to be of the opinion that <strong>Sofia Vergara</strong> has had plastic surgery. But she has never admitted to going under the knife ever. What's interesting is that when talking about cosmetic surgery, she has never ruled it out either. In a 2012 interview, she shared that she would definitely get some minor tweaking in the future. (She would not do that to look young because as she once told Health magazine, if you get plastic surgery with the mentality of looking young, accidents happen because it can only make you look prettier, not young.)</p><p><strong>Yeah, I would definitely do something. Not something crazy but little things here or there. Hopefully, when the time comes and I’m considering it, there will be even better treatments out there.</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/sofia-vergara-pic3.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara has never admitted to plastic surgery but she has never ruled it out either. houseandwhips.com" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Sofia Vergara has never admitted to plastic surgery but she has never ruled it out either.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: NBC</strong></p><p>She repeated the same thing in the latter years. In 2014, speaking <a href=# rel=noopener>candidly about cosmetic work</a>, she said,</p><p><strong>Why not? I mean, not yet, but maybe [I’ll do] my under-eye bags in my 50s. We’ll see what I need, but I’m not saying no.</strong></p><p>Sofia Vergara also said that she would get plastic surgery to <a href=# rel=noopener>lift her breasts</a> in the future. Revealing that she requires a size 32F bra on Watch What Happens Live, she said,</p><p><strong>Yeah, eventually I’m going to have to have it. Something’s going to have to be done. It’s going to be really uncomfortable to walk with [them] hitting the knees!</strong></p><p>Has the future where she would have plastic surgery arrived yet? Well, she has not admitted to having any work done so, so far not!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiqqJ6Zlnq3sdGgmKuZXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
