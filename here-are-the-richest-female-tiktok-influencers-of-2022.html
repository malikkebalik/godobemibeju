The platform provides many ways for people to exercise their creativity.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Every so often, though, some people and their content blow up in such a way that their fame reaches levels they and everyone else never thought possible. This fame, if capitalized on, also makes them extremely rich.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Here’s a list of the richest female TikTok stars who, with their talent, creativity, and good management skills, have become the <a href=# rel=follow>best of the bunch</a> when it comes to female content creators on the platform, at least in the financial sense of the word. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Kris Collins</h3><p>If you do not believe in the overnight success or at least over-year success, you just have to look at Kris Collins.</p><p>An out-of-work hairdresser from Vancouver&nbsp;whose job the pandemic took away, Collins turned to TikTok to pass time, mostly because of her brother’s suggestion. There, she <a href=# rel="follow noopener">started putting</a> on a comedy show with recurring characters, all of which she plays, for viewers.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>This blew up so much that the creator now has over 44.9&nbsp;million followers on TikTok and 6.51&nbsp;million subscribers on YouTube. She has been getting showered with sponsorships from companies such as Hershey, Lionsgate, and Pantene. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>This massive growth and the ad revenue she generates, both from sponsorships and YouTube, earned her $4.5 million since the time she became huge, which was within the last year.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Bella Poarch</h3><p>The third-most followed person on the platform, Bella Poarch has become this massive within one and a half year. She got her start on TikTok in August 2020, and her silly lip-sync video became the most watched clip on the platform in 2020.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>This all started after her stint as a helicopter mechanic in the U.S. Navy. Now, though, she gets regular sponsorships from companies like Google, Prada, and Tinder. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She also has a <a href=# rel=follow>full-blown career</a> as a <a href=# rel=follow>pop star</a>, releasing many hits in the recent past. All these have made her over $5 million in 2021, the fourth highest in the industry.</p><h3>Dixie D’Amelio</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>Dixie D’Amelio</a>, the older of the D’Amelio sisters, is the lesser-followed sibling on TikTok.</p><p>Still, over 57 million followers is no joke, and no mistake, either. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Dixie, who started on TikTok alongside her sister with a clean, regular next-door girl image, is now trying to get out of that image that helped her to superstardom. And she is doing that through <a href=# rel=follow>marketing and music</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She released two singles in 2021, officially beginning her pop music career, and toured the country performing all over.</p><p>Her TikTok influence remains, though, and so keeps coming the promotional offers. With all these, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">made $2.9</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">million</a> in 2020, $10 million in 2021, and has a reported net worth of over $6 million as of 2022. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h3>Addison Rae</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>Addison Rae</a> is one of the first names you think of when you think of a TikTok superstar. The creator has left such a mark on the platform that she has almost become the unofficial face of it.</p><p>In 2020, she was the highest-earning creator on the platform, raking in $5 million. In 2021, that amount went up to $8.5 million, but still less than the younger D’Amelio sister. In 2021, Rae also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started her Hollywood career</a>, appearing as the lead in Netflix’s She’s All That.</p><p>Reportedly, she also has a contract with the company for a few more movies. Further, sponsorships from American Eagle, and her own beauty line with Madeby Collective, have shot up her net worth to be somewhere around $15 million.</p><h3>Charli D’Amelio</h3><p><a href=# rel=follow>Charli D’Amelio</a>, the younger of the D’Amelio sisters, is the more successful one. The TikTok star still has her clean image going for her, <a href=# rel=follow>despite</a> <a href=# rel=follow>her many online bouts</a> with other influencers. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She has over 143.9&nbsp;million followers on her TikTok, the second-most on the platform (<a href=# rel=follow>only behind Khaby Lame</a>), and leverages this influence for sponsorship deals, for which she charges over $100 thousand per sponsored video.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p></p><p><strong>Charli D'Amelio, the richest female TikTok star of 2022.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-174 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The little sister has deals with Hollister and Morphe, Invisalign, Dunkin Donuts, to name a few, the latter of which has her signature drinks on offer. Other than these, she has also appeared in a Super Bowl commercial.</p><p>All this resulted in a massive income of $4 million in 2020, which jumped to a whopping $17.5 million in 2021. Her reported net worth is around $20 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKqZmLWmv9NmnZ6lkaGybsDIpKuoo12owaK%2B0mefraWc</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
