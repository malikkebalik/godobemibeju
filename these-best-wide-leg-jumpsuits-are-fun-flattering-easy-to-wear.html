Jumpsuits are one of the easiest pieces of clothing to wear as they usually only require the addition of your favorite accessories (shoes, jewelry, and purse). They are also travel-friendly, on-trend, and can provide a long, lean silhouette when paired with your favorite high heels or boots."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A little black dress can make you feel exposed at times, whereas a wide-leg jumpsuit will make you feel fully covered but equally elegant and sexy. Since jumpsuits are so versatile, they look fabulous at the mall or at festivals, depending on the material used. You can wear it to a formal event or while having casual drinks in a bar.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Wide-leg jumpsuits are easy to accessorize and can be worn with both heels and flats. Whatever the occasion, there is a wide-leg jumpsuit for you out there. With our help, it will not take you long to find it!</span></p><h3><b>Sleeve Type Makes a Huge Difference</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The type of sleeves an outfit has can drastically change its entire look. For example, jumpsuits that would otherwise look plain can be livened up with a ruffled sleeve or an asymmetrical look with one sleeve. Continue reading to be inspired by some of the sleeve types available:</span></p><h4><b>Off-shoulder</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you want an off-shoulder jumpsuit, you can choose a plain hem at the top. Alternatively, you may prefer something with more details such as feathers or ruffles. One-shoulder options look stylish and are a great option if you cannot decide between no sleeves or two sleeves. Off-shoulder and one-shoulder jumpsuits can have both long or short sleeves.</span></p><h4><b>Long sleeves</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Long sleeves can feel stretchy and tight or more like the sleeves of a shirt with button closures at the bottom. The sleeves can also hang loosely with slits down the sides.</span></p><h4><b>Short sleeves</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Short sleeves look great on a wide-leg jumpsuit because they balance out the mass of material around your calves. Short sleeves also come in different lengths and can be tight or flowing. If you want to cover the top of your arms in the summer, consider wearing short sleeves down to the elbow, made from some sort of lightweight chiffon material.</span></p><h4><b>Straps</b></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are many different types of straps. Consider the thickness of the straps on the jumpsuit you choose. If you are wearing a bra with a jumpsuit, select wide enough straps to hide your bra straps. Alternatively, you could wear a strapless bra. Some of the available straps in a jumpsuit include:</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Spaghetti straps</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Cross over straps</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Halterneck</span></li></ul><h3><b>A Beautiful Neckline Will Elevate Your Look</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Do an image search for the following types of necklines and see which look you like the most. Then, consider how comfortable you will feel in each neckline and choose one that is appropriate for the event or location you plan on wearing your wide-leg jumpsuit.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Boat</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Edge</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Deep</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Carmen</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Halter</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Jewel</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Illusion</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Keyhole</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Portrait</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Polo</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>V-neck</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Sweetheart</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Surplice</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Square</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Scoop</span></li></ul><h3><b>Show Off Your Personality With the Right Color and Pattern</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>You will look fabulous in a red, beige, yellow, coral, or brown jumpsuit if you have olive skin and other warm undertones. However, if you have cooler skin with bluish or pink hues, you are better looking for a jumpsuit with cool colors. This includes greens, blues, pinks, purples, and white.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, if you wanted to incorporate some cooler or warmer tones into your outfit, you could do so by choosing a jumpsuit with patterned material. Ensure the warm or cool tones you need are the predominant colors in your outfit to make it work.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Floral patterns are on-trend right now, but you will be able to find many more. If you want a bold look, you could opt for a jumpsuit made entirely from patterned material. However, most agree that this looks a little too much, especially with a flared or wide leg. So instead, consider purchasing a jumpsuit with only a pattern on the upper or lower half independently.</span></p><h3><b>What About the Waist?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>The waist of a jumpsuit can be higher up than your actual waist or right on it. It is rarely at the hips. You may want to look for a jumpsuit with dark material around the waist and a lighter color throughout the rest of the jumpsuit. This will bring you in at the waist and create a more hourglass figure. If you are petite, a high waist may make you look taller.</span></p><h3><b>Extra Jumpsuit Features to Consider</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are many more features to consider before you purchase a wide-leg jumpsuit. We love leg side slits. They add a little sex appeal while keeping you covered up. Lace tops are in fashion right now, but not wide lace legs. Having a lace material on the top of the jumpsuit and a plain fabric at the bottom is slimming.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>We also love cape and drape details, a simple bonus material to create a dramatic look. Sometimes the cape can look like a perfectly matched jacket, and the drape can make the jumpsuit look like a dress/jumpsuit hybrid.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Choose a wide-leg playsuit with shoulder pads if you want to feel like the most powerful woman in the room. As long as you do not opt for 80s hair and makeup, it will not look like a costume.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Most jumpsuits are designed to look slim and streamlined. However, you can find them with pockets if you look for them. We recommend choosing pretty stealthy pockets with this type of jumpsuit, as prominent pockets may look a little childlike.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>How long should wide-leg jumpsuits be?<p><span style=font-weight:400>The hem of wide-leg jumpsuits should reach above your toes and rest on the top of your foot. However, it can be difficult to find a jumpsuit that is the right length, so measure the length of your legs before you shop.</span></p>What are the best shoes to wear with wide-leg jumpsuits?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Wide-leg jumpsuits look best with block heels. If you do not like walking in heels, you could opt for a block heel with a platform. Wide-leg jumpsuits also look great with open-toe shoes or pointed shoes. Avoid round-toe shoes because the leg is already wide and round.</span></p>Does wearing a jumpsuit make it difficult to pee?<p><span style=font-weight:400>If you are worried about the logistics of taking off your jumpsuit when you pee, purchase a jumpsuit with an easy-to-reach zip, low and to the side. This will make going to the bathroom much easier.</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
