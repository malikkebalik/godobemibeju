The mom-of-two added, “Thanks&nbsp;@donsaladino&nbsp;for kickin my A double S into shape. 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose. Feeling very proud 💪😁💪.” Pretty inspirational, right? We love how honest Blake is with her fans too, I mean, she didn’t get that gorgeous figure overnight — and she’s totally ok with that!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>In the photo, Blake’s sporting a black criss-cross sports bra and a pair of black high-waisted leggings with sheer paneling. There’s no question she looks like a fitness goddess! After Blake gave birth to her first daughter,<strong> James</strong>, back in 2014, the star had just eight months to get toned for her movie The Shallows. To get into the best shape of her life,&nbsp;Blake made one major change to her diet.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/blake-lively-61-pound-weight-loss-embed.jpg alt="Before and after pic of Blake Lively's pregnancy" width=620 height=700 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Speaking with Australian radio hosts&nbsp;Kyle and Jacki O&nbsp;about her get-fit-quick secret, Blake said her post-baby diet meant “No processed foods.”&nbsp;“What we actually did was no gluten and no soy. It seems like it was really easy to cut out but you realize there is soy in everything,” she said. “Even if it’s healthy, whole foods or organic stuff there’s always soy in it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>That first time around, Blake also trained with <strong>Don&nbsp;Saladino</strong>. “Hard work and dedication pays off! Wonderful job, you’re on fire 🔥,” a fan commented on her Feb. 12 photo. Another gushed, “You are a true inspiration…. Im 12 weeks post partum… Trying to get back into shape. Difficult with two kids… But trying. Thank you for sharing the truth of how long it took you to lose the W8.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — how amazing does Blake look?
