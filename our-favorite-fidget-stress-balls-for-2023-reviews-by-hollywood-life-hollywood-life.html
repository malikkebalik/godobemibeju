With tons of things to consider, you need to make sure you know what you’re looking for if you don’t want your stress ball to tear on the first day. Therefore, here’s a short guide to highlighting the factors you should take into account while picking out a fidget stress ball.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Thermoplastic Rubber Balls vs. Silicon Rubber Balls</span></h3><p><span>When it comes to choosing a stress ball, there are two main types of rubber to choose from: thermoplastic rubber (TPR) and silicone rubber. TPR is a softer, more flexible material that offers a satisfying squishiness when squeezed. It's also generally less expensive than silicone. However, TPR can be more difficult to clean and is not as durable as silicone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Silicone rubber, on the other hand, is a firmer, more compact material that retains its shape better over time. It's also non-porous, making it easier to clean, and is more heat resistant than TPR. As a result, silicone rubber stress balls are often preferred by people who want a longer-lasting anxiety-relieving toy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Important Details for Buying Fidget Stress Balls</span></h3><h4><b>Robustness</b></h4><p><span>When looking for a fidget stress ball, robustness should be one of your top considerations. After all, you don't want your ball to get punctured or leak easily! A robust stress ball will be able to withstand more squeezing and tossing, giving you relief from stress for longer. Furthermore, a well-made robust ball will also have a smooth surface that is pleasant to the touch.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Texture</b></h4><p><span>One important factor to consider is the texture of the ball. Some people prefer a soft, fabric-like texture, while others like something that they can pull or squeeze. Sometimes people also like something that moves when they fiddle with it. Consider what kind of texture would be most relaxing for you and look for a fidget stress ball that has that texture.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><b>Durability</b></h4><p><span>When choosing a stress ball, it's important to consider durability. A stress ball that is too soft will quickly lose its shape, and a stress ball that is too hard will be difficult to squeeze. The ideal stress ball should be made of a material that is firm but flexible, such as silicone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Silicone stress balls are also less likely to tear or puncture, which means they can withstand more squeezing and squeezing. In addition, silicone stress balls can often be cleaned in the dishwasher, making them a more sanitary option than other types of stress balls.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwvMSrqqimkaF6pK3RnmafoZScsrV50q2pnqujYq%2BiuMto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
