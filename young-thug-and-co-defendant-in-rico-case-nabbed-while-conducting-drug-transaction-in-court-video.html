Grammy-winning rapper Young Thug, also known as Jeffery Lamar Williams, and a racketeering co-defendant are accused of conducting a hand-to-hand drug transaction during a court hearing.
Fulton County prosecutors allege that the exchange was captured on courtroom surveillance video on January 19.
The prosecutors claimed that Thug’s co-defendant, Kahlieff Adams, was seen handing the rapper a bag of Percocets, despite two bailiffs being nearby."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Adams, who is a defendant in the YSL RICO case, is already serving a life-without-parole sentence for murder.</p><p>It was also alleged that Thug tried to conceal the painkillers under the table before the county’s sheriff’s deputies recovered the alleged Percocets and attempted to search Adams.</p><p>Adams resisted the search and was then taken to a nearby hospital because “he appeared to ingest other items of contraband that he held on his person, in an effort to conceal the extent of his crimes within the courtroom.”</p><p>The deputies ultimately found a series of other drugs on Adams’ person, including: Percocet, marijuana, and other contraband “wrapped in plastic and food seasonings to mask the odor of the marijuana.”</p><p>Percocet is the brand name of a drug that mixes oxycodone, an opioid, and acetaminophen, a generic name for drugs such as Tylenol.</p><p>Keith Adams, one of Young Thug’s attorneys, stated to CNN affiliate WSB-TV, “His side is the truth. The reality is Mr. Williams had nothing to do with what went on in the courtroom on yesterday.”</p><p>Adams also informed WSB-TV that Young Thug did not know it was Percocet being handed to him.</p><p>“On behalf of Mr. Adams, these allegations are simply that: mere statements made by the state in an effort to thwart the lengthiness of the jury selection process.”</p><p>The rapper was initially indicted in May on charges of conspiracy to violate the RICO Act and participation in criminal street gang activity. A re-indictment filed on August 5 in Fulton County Superior Court accuses him of nine new charges, including participating in criminal street gang activity and violating the Georgia Controlled Substances Act. He also was indicted on other charges of possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony and possession of a machine gun.</p><p>Watch a video of the in-court drug transaction below</p><p></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiwqK2enHq1tNSgZJqmlGKwsHnDnp2eppSWu7V5yKdkq6GTpHqkrdKeZKeZkpeypXnWoaClnV2YvK%2Bw1JyroqaXYrGzwcZmq6uZnqiupMDIqKVmoZ5isLDB0a1kr6GUmrxw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
