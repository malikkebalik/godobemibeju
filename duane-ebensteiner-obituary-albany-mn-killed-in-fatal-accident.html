Duane Ebensteiner will be remembered at the Seven Dolors Catholic Church in Albany, where the Mass will be said. The church will host a visiting service beginning at nine in the morning on Friday, and it will take place there.</p><p>On October 5, 2023, Duane died abruptly at his home from injuries he had acquired in a farm accident. The cause of death was a sad accident. Internal hemorrhage was the underlying cause of death. At this time, the Miller-Carlin Funeral Homes are the ones in charge of making the necessary arrangements. Duane Walter Ebensteiner was born into the world on July 31, 1955 in the city of St. Cloud, Minnesota.</p><p>His parents, Anthony and Helen (Ostendorf) Ebensteiner, were overjoyed to become parents. They went to the Mary of Immaculate Conception Church in Rockville, Minnesota, on February 28th, 1976, to exchange their vows and become husband and wife. The beautiful bride’s name was Elaine Paulette Feldhous. They did everything together, from bringing up their three daughters in Albany, where they lived together throughout their lives, where they did everything.</p><p>Over the span of more than half a century, Duane laid flooring with an attention to detail that was unrivaled by anybody else in the industry. He was happy to enjoy a life of semi-retirement up until very recently, when he made a sudden decision to return to full-time work.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsNSapZ5llZeyr7%2FTnqCnnaJivKO1066Yq7Fdlrmjrc2yZKamXaC2rbjEnWSipl2brrWty2aYnJuZmbKvwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
