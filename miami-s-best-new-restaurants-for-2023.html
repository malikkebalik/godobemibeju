All of them have just emerged from major renovations that render them contenders for the title of “icon.”</p><p>From Brickell to Sunny Isles, here are the half-dozen tried-and-true retreats which prove that in Miami, everything old is new again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pastis, 380 NW 26th St.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large is-resized">Keith McNally’s new Miami spot is the best new bistro in town. <span class=credit>Lens Craving</span></figure><p>Keith McNally — the raconteur restaurateur behind several of NYC’s favorite elbow-rubbing eateries — has arrived in South Florida. His iconic bistro Pastis is now operating eponymously in Wynwood.</p><p>Opened in April, plats du jour are rotating Escoffier-esque classics, from duck à l’orange and Dover sole à la meunière to bouillabaisse and crêpe complète (right).</p><p>It’s no stuffy Lyonnaise bouchon either: The place sets the mood with globe lights, white tile, rustic wood furniture and an airy garden — all capped off with a certain anise-flavored cooler sipped under the Miami sun.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rao’s Miami Beach, 1601 Collins Ave.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image alignnone size-large">The Rao’s restaurant offers Italian cuisine for the Miami-based gourmand. <span class=credit>PABLO MEDINA</span></figure><p>Yes, this is that Rao’s.</p><p>And yes, you can make reservations.</p><p>NYC’s clubbiest restaurant and purveyor of jarred red sauce — known for yesteryear mafioso, gigantic portions of pasta (including the fiochette, above) and ultra-exclusivity — is now taking bookings at the Loews Miami Beach.</p><p>Just like back home, Rao’s Miami Beach serves its signature meatballs, Sunday gravy and even Uncle Vincent’s lemon chicken.</p><p>But in a nod to its fresher surroundings, the 127-year-old brand is adding a seafood tower, caviar and a catch of the day to the menu.</p><p>The decor has also been Miami-fied. While its dark, downstairs Harlem location could be described as Martin Scorsese-core, things are airier here with marble tables on the patio and modern upscale decor inside. Goomahs welcome.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Amelia’s 1931, 13601 SW 26th St.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large is-resized">Amelia’s is known for swerving up Latin cuisine with an Asian flair.</figure><p>Chef and restaurateur Eileen Andrade spent the last three years transforming her small Cuban diner, Amelia’s, into the atmospheric, decidedly retro Amelia’s 1931.</p><p>Now serving pan-Latin cuisine (with an Asian twist), this slightly far-flung jewel box dining room is hidden behind a defunct dry cleaner. (There’s even a wall of cleaned and bagged clothes to prove it.)</p><p>Past the speak-easy curtain, the sultry dining room hums with classic cocktails (e.g. Clover Clubs, paper planes and mules) and zingy dishes like gochujang paella, arroz con pato and Frita sliders (above).</p><p>Best of all — and very true to its dry cleaner-meets-speak-easy theme — there is a strictly enforced biz-caz dress code and a soft no-child policy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Branja</a>, 5010 NE Second Ave.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image alignnone size-large">Branja is a hot spot for playful rebellion and exciting cuisine.</figure><p>“MasterChef Israel” winner and self-described “flavor rebel,” Tom Aviv makes his US restaurant debut with Branja, located just north of the Design District.</p><p>An homage to Tel Aviv in the ’70s, with retro design and flavors, the menu teases a section named “Foreplay” (featuring “fish & bread,” tuna tartare and cured salmon).</p><p>Things get even kinkier from there. The “not a Caesar” salad comes with Parmesan vinaigrette and strawberry.</p><p>There is a fish mélange with labneh tahini and mango amba called Fishwarma (not to mention the Falafish).</p><p>And you don’t have to be devout to order the steak frites. (We assume this NY strip is rabbi approved.)</p><p>Wash it down with a shot of arak.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tablé by Antonio Bachour, 180 NE 40th St.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large is-resized">Any meal is up for grabs at Bachour’s Parisian-style Miami location.</figure><p>It’s OK to be a flake when your game is pastry, and Antonio Bachour makes some of the flakiest.</p><p>The renowned dough boy and award-winning chef is at it again with a new, modern Parisian-style brasserie in the Design District.</p><p>Opened in March, Tablé has full brunch, lunch and dinner menus — chilled lobster Andalouse, duck magret, crudité with avocado hummus (above) — infused with a France-meets-Middle East flair.</p><p>The space is spread between a stylish interior dining room, a bar and an outdoor patio.</p><p>But for those Bachour loyalists there is also a café section with grab ’n’ go baked goods and sandwiches.</p><p>But why not hang around for steak frites or some caviar and chips?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brasserie Laurel, 689 NE First Ave.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large is-resized">Caviar and chill with Michelin star chef Michel Beltran. <span class=credit>© 2022 All Rights Reserved to FujifilmGirl, LLC</span></figure><p>Brasserie Laurel, another brassy brasserie, is adding casual French flavor to South Florida, this time at the base of Miami Worldcenter’s Caoba residential tower.</p><p>Ariete Hospitality Group and Michelin-starred chef-owner Michael Beltran aim to take a boîte out of the competition with suave suppers and valiant vins.</p><p>Caviar service kicks off the menu, followed by frog legs, foie gras and escargot.</p><p>Need more classic French cookery?</p><p>Try the turbot, entrecôte or boeuf en croûte.</p><p>Toast bon appétit with a rum-based Beneath the Sheets (below) or snag a $10 sparkling wine or a $9 martini during happy hour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Casadonna</a>, 1737 N. Bayshore Drive</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large">Catch some rays and enjoy antipasti at Grutman’s indoor-outdoor restaurant.</figure><p>In October, David Grutman’s Groot Hospitality and Tao Group Hospitality took over a space in Miami’s historic Woman’s Club in Edgewater.</p><p>The result is Casadonna (below), an Italian Riviera-inspired restaurant based around the traditional antipasti, crudi and primi of Naples, Taormina, Bari, Positano and Gaeta — with a modern twist, of course.</p><p>Branzino (con pine-nut gremolata)?</p><p>Tagliatelle (con lemon and caviar)?</p><p>Wagyu carpaccio (con Parmesan and black truffle)?</p><p>Check. Check. Check.</p><p>And in true moda Italiana, this place does it large: There’s indoor and outdoor seating for 366 here in a space bedecked by designer Ken Fulk.</p><p>While nodding to the room’s clubby past, Fulk livens things up with gold and greenery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Tala Beach, 2341 Collins Ave.</h2><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image max-height-none alignnone size-large is-resized">Say cheers at this Mediterranean-style beach club.</figure><p>In October, 1 Hotel South Beach revealed its reimagined backyard, beachfront party hub.</p><p>The former Tulum-inspired 1 Beach Club is now Tala, a 50,000-square-foot, Mediterranean-inspired playpen.</p><p>All al fresco, this redesign sprawls with daybeds, overstuffed pillows, textured rugs, big umbrellas, palm trees and an outdoor bar and restaurant.</p><p>Cocktails are king here.</p><p>Have a Santorini Sunrise or an Eros Penicillin in the VIP lounge.</p><p>Of course, this is Miami, so you could get bottle service — especially during its Saturday evening live-music party dubbed Tala Nights.</p><p>Hot-weather faves like mez</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGtmaW5fobansdKtsKWdX6K2ornIrGSbnaOpeq%2Bx1mapnquklsKzrc2tqmaen6d6c3yRbGRrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
