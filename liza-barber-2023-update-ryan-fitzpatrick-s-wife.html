The LA Times, a prominent newspaper, wrote:</span></p><p>“Fitzpatrick purchased a ring with money from a joint bank account that he and Barber shared. He hid it somewhere in his car, then picked it up for a day’s shopping at the St. Louis mall.</p><p>“They stopped at a clothing store, the clerk unintentionally double-charged it, and Barber said she didn’t care because she would check the account online when she got home.”</p><p><span>Anyway, he got the ring and hid it, hoping to propose at the right moment.
