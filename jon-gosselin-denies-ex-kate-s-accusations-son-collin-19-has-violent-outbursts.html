Kate said she never wanted to speak out regarding her difficult relationship with Collin, but she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE </a>on Friday, July 21 that she felt she had “no other choice.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I feel I have been backed into a corner and left with no choice. Although it saddens me to do so, I need to speak out now,” Kate began. “My son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years,” she alleged. “For the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Kate-Gosselin-collin-gosselin-Violent-Behavior-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>She added, “Unfortunately, I believe Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help. His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Jon and Collin have openly discussed Collin’s past hospitalization when he was 12 years old. During their appearance on Tuesday’s Vice TV’s Dark Side of the 2000s, Jon revealed that he had spent a substantial amount, around $1 million, to help Collin with his treatment. In a 2019 interview with the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>, Jon mentioned that, at that time, Collin’s only known medical condition was ADHD, and there were no other diagnosed issues.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In Kate’s conclusion of her lengthy message, she said, “What his sister <strong>Mady</strong> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>posted</a> on social media recently is completely accurate and I deeply appreciate her bravery in doing so.” In a post to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> on Thursday morning, Mady responded to her brother’s claims, saying, “I do not owe my allegiance to any person(s) who has physically threatened me and every member of my immediate family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Both Jon and Collin have denied that the 19-year-old engaged in violent conduct at any time. Collin has been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>estranged from Kate </a>since 2018, when he and his sister <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hannah </a>went to live with their father. Collin remains <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>estranged from his six other siblings</a> as well. They include 22-year-old <strong>Cara</strong> and four other sextuplets, <strong>Aaden</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alexis</strong>,&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Joel</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Leah</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FrZqOnnmK0sL%2FSnqOipl2nsqKv06xkpJmkmnq0u81mmqiknJ67bsLIqKOepqRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
