Controversy has arisen around her involvement in the 1938 film ‚ÄúEverybody Sing,‚Äù in which she portrayed a character briefly seen in blackface. This discussion has sparked debates on platforms like Twitter, as netizens grapple with the complexities of historical context and evolving attitudes toward racism.</p><p>The controversy was sparked by a tweet from user @browardbully, which featured two side-by-side images of Judy Garland: one in blackface from ‚ÄúEverybody Sing‚Äù and the other as Dorothy from ‚ÄúThe Wizard of Oz.‚Äù The post went viral, with many individuals accusing Garland of participating in a racially insensitive practice.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>two movies. a year apart. same bitch.<br>shoutout to Gen Z for teaching me this. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/kAb0EZN2QN</a></p><p>‚Äî Twi. üá≠üáπ (from RUNNING TRIZZ) (@browardbully) <a href=# rel=noopener>August 16, 2023</a></p><p>In response to the heated discussion, Twitter added a message beneath the picture, acknowledging that Garland was a minor during the time of the film and lacked agency over her decisions due to abusive management. Twitter also emphasized that she later became an ardent supporter of the Civil Rights movement, signifying her growth and change over time.</p><p>‚ÄúEverybody Sing,‚Äù directed by Edwin L. Marin and produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, was a musical released in 1938. In the film, Judy Garland portrayed the character Judy Bellaire, who spurs her school choir to modernize a classical song, leading to her expulsion from her prestigious school. With the help of Allan Jones‚Äôs character, Ricky Saboni, she pursues her dream of auditioning for a musical.</p><p></p><p>Controversy revolves around a specific scene in which Judy Garland‚Äôs character uses dark makeup to disguise herself. This practice, known as blackface, was once common in early films but is now recognized as offensive and hurtful due to increased awareness about racism.</p><p>Judy Garland‚Äôs life was marked by both professional success and personal struggles. Suffering from mental and physical health issues from a young age, she also battled drug addiction and financial woes as an adult.

While the current debate over her involvement in blackface highlights the complexities of historical context, many social media users are keen to correct the narrative. They emphasize that Garland‚Äôs life was marked by challenges and circumstances beyond her control, and her later support for civil rights demonstrates a meaningful evolution in her perspective.</p><p>Ultimately, the viral images and claims suggesting Garland‚Äôs racism underscore the importance of considering the broader context of her life and career.
