Taiju is greatly enraged by Takemitchi’s assertion that she will take control of The Black Dragon. Hakkai begs Takemitchi to back off because he has been seriously injured. <a href=# rel=noopener>Takemitchi</a>, though, is unyielding. In addition, Hakkai told everyone his secret.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Hakkai admits to lying to Takemitchi about defending Yuzuha. Yuzuha had been defending her younger brother instead. Hakkai claims that since he had never opposed Taiju, he was forced to kill him. Takemitchi disparages Hakkai as lame, but he sticks by his friend. Mitsuya remembers leaving his house because his life was miserable. Hakkai is inspired by him to fight and defend his family.</p><p style=text-align:justify>While <a href=# rel=noopener>Mitsuya</a> and Chifuyu combat Taiju and Kokonoi, Hakkai and Takemitchi battle Taiju. Yuzuha is also reminded of the commitment she made to her mother as a young child. As part of a vow to her mother, Yuzuha has been guarding Hakkai. Hakkai is informed by Taiju that his group has surrounded the chapel. He continues by saying that God is testing him because he would now have to kill both of his family members.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Hakkai tries to fight Taiju after Takemitchi falls unconscious. He hears Mikey’s bike outside the chapel at the same time. Mickey bids everyone a happy holiday season and inquires as to what is going on at the church.</p><p style=text-align:justify><b>Here are some articles related to this post:</b></p><ul style=text-align:justify><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Sisu Release Date: Is This Movie Confirmed To Release?</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Taxi Driver 2 Episode 5 Release Date: Is This Series Coming Soon?</a></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify><span style=font-weight:400>We hope this article will satisfy your needs and that you enjoy it.
