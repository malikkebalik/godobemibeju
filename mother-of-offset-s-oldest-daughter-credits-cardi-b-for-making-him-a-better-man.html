And even though they’ve had their differences in the past years, Shya recently admitted in an interview with TMZ that the Migos’ member has matured a lot since he started a relationship with wife Cardi B.</p><p class=fh>According to Shya, Cardi has been a good influence on the man and has helped him “grow tremendously.”</p><p class=fh>“Since he's been with her, I've seen a lot of growth,” she said. And when asked if Cardi has welcomed his other kids around, she added,</p><p class=fh>“She does [embrace Kalea], she does. I can see her heart. She has a really good heart.”</p><p class=fh>Kalea and her siblings: Jordan, Kody, and Kulture, were officially introduced to the world on the cover of “Father of Four,” Offset’s first EP as a solo artist.</p><p class=fh>In one of the songs, Offset name-dropped the 3-year-old, asking for her forgiveness since he missed the first years of her life. He rapped:</p><p class=fh>“Kalea, you my first, first daughter / I missed the first years of your life, I'm sorry / Tell the truth, I ain't really know if I was your father / Tell the truth, I really don't even know your mama.”</p><p class=fh>Indeed, the adorable girl was the product of a Fourth of July one-night-stand between her parents. At the time L’Amour was living in Atlanta, and when she first reached out to Offset offering him to take a DNA test, she was met with rejection and blocked from all social media.</p><p class=fh>After hearing the lyrics referencing her daughter, Shya was caught off guard and took to <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/shya_lamour/>Instagram</a> to vent about the situation. “I feel like lowkey he put the blame back on me by saying [he] didn’t know me when it was both of our faults,” she stated.</p><p class=fh>The 30-year-old also revealed that she was all by herself by the time she gave birth, and that Offset met Kalea when the girl was already 1-year-old.</p><p class=fh>However, L’Amour later apologized for her outburst, explaining that she got caught in her feelings and assuring that all is good between her and the father of her child.</p><p class=fh>Most importantly, she says Kalea loves her daddy.</p><p class=fh>“He has stepped up, and he has been around, as of lately, to show that affection that she needs - that parental love that her mother can't do that for the father,” she said. And added of her relationship with Offset:</p><p class=fh>“In an ideal scenario, just get on the same page, man. Just gotta have an understanding and keep an understanding. I feel like communication is key to a lot of misunderstandings.”</p><p class=fh>Talking about his kids to Esquire, Offset <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a26391612/offset-cardi-b-relationship-solo-album-2019-interview/>mentioned</a> he wants to make sure he’s present in their lives to build a more positive model of fatherhood than the one he got from his biological father, with whom he last spoke years ago.</p><p class=fh>“Have you seen my kids?! They’re beautiful” the Red Room rapper bragged. He added that the kids help him keep <a class="Ed a" href=#>grounded</a> because when he gets home from work, he gets to unwind, relax and be a “regular person.”</p><p class=fh>“I cried to myself while I was doing this album ’cause I was talking about my story and my kids,” he <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a26391612/offset-cardi-b-relationship-solo-album-2019-interview/>said</a> of the new record.</p><p class=fh>“When I did a song, I started getting memories of my grandma, my struggles, my partner that was killed, the thoughts I had while I was incarcerated, and my kids’ faces were there in my head. I love my kids; this is who I do it for.”</p><p class=fh>Now that Offset and Cardi B are back on track with their marriage, the rapper couldn’t be in a better place. The couple is currently on a tropical vacation, and the “Money” rapper has been <a class="Ed a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bupb8gBlY5c/>documenting</a> the trip on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpqcG9jbHquu9OhnKtln5uztLHTrGSopJSawLV5w5qsoKCkmr9ur9Gem6Kso2Kwb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
