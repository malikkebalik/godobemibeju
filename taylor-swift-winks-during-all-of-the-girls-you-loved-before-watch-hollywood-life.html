While Taylor is known for her cryptic messaging, this move seemed to imply she was over a past relationship — possibly Joe, who she dated for nearly seven years from 2016 to sometime in the spring of 2023. Taylor also had a brief reported fling with The 1975 singer <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Matty Healy</strong></a> through May and June, and the two were even seen holding hands at Casa Cipriani in New York City — but their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>relationship fizzled just a few weeks in</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joe-Alwyn-Seen-Out-ss-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>“Every woman that you knew brought you here / I wanna teach you how forever feels like,” she sings on the track. “All of the girls you’ve loved before (Ooh) / Made you the one I’ve fallen for / Every dead-end street led you straight to me,” she also says in the lyrics on the song, seemingly about Joe based on the word choice and era.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/taylor-swift-matty-healy-studio-nyc-spl-embed1-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>The initial lyric about “cryin’ in the bathroom,” however, is believed to have been originally written for ex-boyfriend <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jake Gyllenhaal</strong></a>. Despite their 10 year age gap, 19 year old Taylor and 29 year old Jake briefly dated in the Fall of 2010. The track “<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>All Too Well</a>” tells the tale of the ill-fated romance, where she also sings “Not weeping in a party bathroom / Some actress asking me what happened, you, that’s what happened, you,” which could be about the same incident. On&nbsp;Red‘s “Moment I Knew,” she once again sings about what seems to be the same night with the lyrics, “And there in the bathroom / I try not to fall apart / And the sinking feeling starts / As I say hopelessly / ‘He said he’d be here'”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5JpZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2stq%2B30maYpaRdpLNuwMeeZKChoqHAbsXOrmSlp6aasW6uxJ%2Bmq51dq7alsc5o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
