Having been home since March 9, I’m totally out of my normal routine of traveling through various airports, hotels, rental car facilities — and, yes, restaurants — in the process of covering races all over the country.</p><p>I’ve been on the NASCAR beat since 2007, and during that time I’ve attended 388 Cup Series race weekends (I keep count like a nerd). Though it’s common to eat meals at the track, that’s also a lot&nbsp;of dining out.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>So in honor of&nbsp;The Athletic’s <a href=#>Food and Drink Week</a>, I wanted to reminisce about the road days and compile a list of my favorite places to eat in each race market. Maybe you can join me for a meal when the pandemic is all over.</p><p>A couple notes before we get started: I’m <strong>not</strong> <strong>saying this is the best restaurant</strong> near each track, just my <strong>personal favorite</strong>. Also, “near” each track can vary since the hotels or areas where I’ve stayed can be much farther from some tracks than others.</p><p>Anyway, here we go. These are in alphabetical order by track.</p><h3><strong>Atlanta Motor Speedway</strong></h3><p>Restaurant: Spondivits (23 miles from the track). 1219 Virginia Ave., East Point.</p><p>With Hampton being south of the Atlanta airport, many of those working the race stay in airport-area hotels. That limits options for dining, as the trek into Atlanta itself (and the prospect of battling traffic) doesn’t sound so fun at times.</p><p>That leaves chain options and a few independent mainstays like Spondivits. It’s an older seafood restaurant near a highway (not the most scenic area, to be sure), but the seafood buckets with garlic butter — as well as the clam chowder — make it worth the likely wait for a table.</p><h3>Auto Club Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Thai Diamond BBQ (8 miles from track). 9581 Foothill Blvd., Rancho Cucamonga.</p><p>I don’t expect anyone to ever take this advice or go here, because this is the most random place on the list. But if you like good pad thai, the best I’ve ever had is at this location.</p><p>I’m not going to claim to be a pad thai aficionado, but it’s the only dish I ever get at Thai restaurants. It’s not that I don’t want to expand my horizons, it’s just that I love it that much. But it’s weird how the taste of pad thai in our country can change based on region.</p><p>Posted by <a href=#>Thai diamond BBQ restaurant</a> on&nbsp;<a href=#>Sunday, May 31, 2020</a></p><p>For example: I’ve found pad thai in California seems to be on the sweeter side, whereas in the South, restaurants often serve it spicy (and you have to ask for no spice if you don’t want your mouth to be on fire). I have no idea what the proper pad thai taste should be; only that I really love the version at Thai Diamond.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Underrated” doesn’t even describe this restaurant. My roommate introduced me to it when I worked for a nearby newspaper in 2006, and I can’t remember ever seeing it crowded in going all the years since. It’s in a little strip mall that’s easy to overlook, and most people who walk through the door seem to be picking up to-go orders.</p><p>But take a seat, order yourself a Thai iced tea (with boba, if you want) and don’t miss out on the pad thai.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01220006/thai.jpg alt width=1142 height=1713 sizes="(max-width: 1142px) 100vw, 1142px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01192427/dessert.jpg alt width=720 height=960 sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span readability=2><p><br><span class=credits-text>Thai dessert tray with multilevel coconut in flower shape. (Thai Diamond BBQ / Facebook)</span></p></span><h3>Bristol Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Cootie Brown’s (7 miles from the track). 118 Volunteer Pkwy, Bristol (Tenn.).</p><p>I listed the newer Cootie Brown’s location that opened up a few years ago, but the original in Johnson City is just as good (and apparently there’s now a third location as well). Either way, you can’t go wrong with their extensive menu of pizzas, burgers, sandwiches and salads. This casual stop is definitely a favorite of NASCAR teams and you’ll likely see people from the track eating there during race weekends.</p><p>My favorite thing to order over the years at Cootie Brown’s has been the goat cheeseburger. It has sundried tomatoes, spinach and (obviously) goat cheese, which makes for a great flavor combination.</p><p>Though you might be in for a long wait before being seated, this is one of my favorite stops anywhere on the circuit. The sign outside says “Real Food,” and they’re not lying.</p><h3>Charlotte Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Mac’s Speed Shop (20 miles from the track). 2511 South Blvd., Charlotte, N.C.</p><p>There are now eight Mac’s locations around the Carolinas, but I listed the original for nostalgia reasons. After this restaurant opened in 2005, the whole NASCAR Scene staff used to hit up this spot once a week for lunch. And even though you could argue Midwood Smokehouse has better BBQ, Mac’s remained my go-to place during the 10 years I lived in Charlotte.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It’s a biker-themed joint that offers the best of Carolina barbecue — Eastern and Western. Outsiders may not realize there’s a distinct difference between the sauces used on each side of North Carolina, but there is. Having spent two and a half years living in Rocky Mount, N.C., my introduction was to the vinegar-based Eastern-style sauce. Western N.C. has the sweeter, tangy red sauce you’d be used to seeing in various forms elsewhere.</p><p>Mac’s carries both kinds of sauces, of course. They’re right at your table, so you can experiment. Order a “Big Pig” with slaw on the sandwich and a side of their delicious mac and cheese, and you’ll have no regrets.</p><h3>Chicagoland Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Greek Islands (35 miles from track). 300 E. 22nd St., Lombard.</p><p>After some Twitter friends introduced me to the original Greek Islands location near downtown Chicago, I began going to the second restaurant closer to Chicagoland Speedway. They’re both great and, if you like Greek food, there are few better places in the country.</p><p>Everything is flavorful and filling, even if you don’t know exactly what it is, so try to get as much variety as you can. A sampler platter would be a good choice for that goal. And if you’re with a few people, it’s worth getting the flaming Saganaki cheese appetizer — where the waiter yells, “Opa!”</p><h3>Darlington Raceway</h3><p>Restaurant: Red Bone Alley (12 miles from track). 1903 W Palmetto St., Florence.</p><p>I had to stretch my memory for this one. Most of the time I lived in Charlotte, I’d just drive back and forth from the track each day — which means I probably haven’t stayed in Florence and dined out at a restaurant there in 10 years.</p><p>But while I can’t vouch for the food specifically, I still remember Red Bone Alley’s unique atmosphere. It’s made to look like you’re outside on a Southern city street, except it’s all indoors. Think “Pirates of the Caribbean” at Disneyland and that might help you imagine it. The reviews indicate the experience has held up well over the years, and I’d definitely go back if I ever stayed in Florence again.</p><h3>Daytona International Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Stonewood Grill (4 miles from track). 2150 LPGA Blvd., Daytona Beach.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Look, I know there may be better restaurants or more interesting atmospheres in Daytona Beach. I’ve spent more than a half-year in the area between all the Speedweeks trips and July races, so there have been plenty of places to eat.</p><p>But over the years, I keep finding myself at one of the Stonewood Grill locations. In fact, I was sitting at this restaurant in February, torrential rain coming down outside, when NASCAR officially postponed the Daytona 500. A lot of NASCAR people keep going to BJ’s on International Speedway Blvd., and that’s fine and all. But Stonewood is a nicer version with fresher food.</p><p>It’s worth noting I might have a different take if I stayed beachside. If you like seafood in a casual atmosphere, there’s a lot to be said for Our Deck Down Under or Aunt Catfish’s. But when it’s a long day at the track and you want something a little closer or more upscale, Stonewood is a reliable choice for those who aren’t on the water. Get the seared ahi appetizer as a meal if you want; it’s delicious.</p><h3>Dover International Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Grotto Pizza (all over Delaware; closest one is next to track).</p><p>My NASCAR friends are already rolling their eyes at this one, but I’m ready for a battle. Grotto Pizza is my favorite pizza on the planet, so how can I just toss out the name of another restaurant for this spot? No way!</p><p>I eat Grotto Pizza at least twice every Dover weekend (once at the restaurant and once when they bring it into the media center — even though that gives everyone an opportunity to make fun of me for liking it so much).</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>One of the best days all year is when they bring a stack of <a href=#>@GrottoPizzaDE</a> into the media center. The BEST pizza. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/DVdkjNz3aQ</a></p><p>— Jeff Gluck (@jeff_gluck) <a href=#>September 28, 2013</a></p><p>My family visited Rehoboth Beach (an hour from the track) during some summers growing up, and I always craved Grotto from that point on. Even when I was looking at college options, the fact that the University of Delaware had Grotto locations on campus was a big plus in my teenage mind; it’s no surprise UD became my alma mater.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Why is Grotto so good? It’s not just the cheese and the sauce itself, but the way they layer it into each slice. I’m practically drooling right now thinking of it.</p><p>But it’s not for everyone. Some people in the media center express outright disgust for it and won’t touch it. So when I say I’ve been to Italy and would rather eat pizza from Grotto instead of a corner shop in Rome, they give me weird looks for some reason. I don’t get it.</p><p>Hey, I see you! Why are you shaking your head at me?</p><h3>Homestead-Miami Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Versailles (33 miles from track). 3555 SW 8th St., Miami.</p><p>It’s so cliche to list Versailles as a place to eat in Miami, but there’s a reason why this iconic Cuban restaurant continues to draw locals and tourists alike. Versailles bills itself as “The World’s Most Famous Cuban Restaurant,” and there’s no reason to doubt it. Even though the place is massive and busy, the waiters are helpful in answering questions about Cuban cuisine (especially for a novice like me).</p><p>You’re going to get different takes on where to eat around Homestead from the NASCAR contingent that stays in Key Largo, but I haven’t been able to do that since 2009. My Miami eating experience is mostly around the airport, since that’s typically where my hotel is.</p><p>And if you’re looking for South Beach recommendations … sorry. I’m not your guy for that. (Unless you’re paying, of course.)</p><p>Anyway, even though it’s well out of the Homestead bubble, I’ve run into NASCAR people at Versailles in the past. The food and unique atmosphere make it worth the trip.</p><h3>Indianapolis Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Harry & Izzy’s (5 miles from track). 153 S. Illinois St., Indianapolis.</p><p>While St. Elmo’s is the&nbsp;essential Indianapolis place to eat, I actually prefer its sister restaurant. Harry & Izzy’s is brighter and more casual, while St. Elmo’s has a darker, classier vibe (which isn’t as much my style on a race weekend when I’m tired and just want good food).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>If you’re worried about missing out on the world-famous St. Elmo’s shrimp cocktail by going to Harry & Izzy’s instead, well … don’t be. Harry & Izzy’s actually has it on the menu, too. Both restaurants have excellent options and will cause equal pain on your wallet, so you’re not going to have a bad experience either way.</p><p>But overall, I give the edge to Harry & Izzy’s. My wife Sarah and I actually had the rehearsal dinner for our wedding there, if that tells you how much we like the place.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01192745/Harry-and-Izzys.jpeg alt width=680 height=453 sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span readability=2><p><br><span class=credits-text>(Harry & Izzy’s / Twitter)</span></p></span><h3>Kansas Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Q39 (18 miles from the track). 1000 W 39th St, Kansas City (Mo.).</p><p>Kansas City resident Nick Bromberg has been a great barbecue resource over the years of visiting that city. And although places like Jack Stack and Joe’s Kansas City (inside a gas station!) are beyond delicious, the advantage goes to the Bromberg-recommended Q39.</p><p>Last year, I ate such an incredible meal at Q39 — melt-in-your-mouth brisket, flavorful ribs, smoky chicken, perfectly cooked pulled pork — that I called it quits on meat for a while after that. I’m serious! It was so excellent, I just figured it would be a good meal to end on and only ate fish or vegetarian options for the next 10-plus months until the quarantine finally broke me. Now I’m ready for another round of Q39.</p><h3>Kentucky Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Fusian (41 miles from track). 600 Vine St., Cincinnati, Ohio.</p><p>I’ve only been to five Kentucky races (the least of any Cup track), so I don’t have a ton of experience in the area. When you add in factors like alternating stays between Louisville and Cincinnati over the years to save money on hotels, restaurant recommendations become even harder. I’ve never eaten within 30 minutes of the track.</p><p>But on my most recent trip, I went to a place called Fusian in downtown Cincinnati and liked it so much, I returned the next day. It’s a fast-casual restaurant that essentially resembles a Chipotle for sushi. You walk through the line and tell them everything you want in your sushi roll, then they make it in front of you and cut it up. You can do poke bowls too, of course, but I like the custom roll concept. It’s quick, simple and hits the spot; if I had one near where I live, I’d probably be there twice a week.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h3>Las Vegas Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Peppermill Restaurant and Fireside Lounge (16 miles from track). 2985 Las Vegas Blvd. S, Las Vegas.</p><p>I’ve been naming dinner places on this list because that’s typically when restaurant meals are consumed during NASCAR weekends. But in reality, I like breakfast food more than dinner food — so if you’re like me, I’ve got just the place.</p><p>The Peppermill is a standalone restaurant on the Strip, less than a mile north of the Wynn, but it’s easy to miss since it’s not part of a hotel/casino property. It’s worth a visit, though, especially if you like the retro Vegas feel that seems to be fleeting these days. Inside, the Peppermill is like a diner on steroids with neon lights and over-the-top decor (like trees and shrubs in between tables).</p><p>But the food is the best part. It’s nothing fancy like you’d get at a breakfast place in the Cosmo or something, but the Peppermill’s portions are supersized (it’s hard to imagine many people finish whatever they order) and the dishes themselves are solid.</p><p>It’s a 24-hour restaurant, which offers a lot of flexibility for the party crowd and the business trip crowd. Last year, I woke up really early on race day and was sitting in a booth having pancakes and coffee there at probably 5:30 a.m. It was a perfect way to start the morning before heading to the track.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01220213/Peppermill-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1920 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span><p><br><span class=credits-text>(Courtesy of Jeff Gluck)</span></p></span><h3>Martinsville Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Hops Burger Bar (52 miles from track). 2419 Spring Garden St., Greensboro (N.C.).</p><p>I’ve been going to Martinsville since 2004, but I’ve only actually stayed in Virginia once while covering the race. So all my restaurant experience is either in Greensboro or Winston-Salem, where many people find cheaper and nicer options than the ones near the track.</p><p>Fortunately, both Greensboro and Winson-Salem are surprisingly good restaurant towns, and Hops Burger Bar (with locations in both) has some tasty options after a decent drive from the track. The burgers are quite unique and creative, although there’s usually a wait to be seated since it’s an area hot spot.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>There are also seafood sandwiches and salads for those who don’t like red meat, but all of the food is worth Yelp-ing home about. I’ve eaten there probably four times now, have gotten a different sandwich every time and never regretted any of them.</p><h3>Michigan International Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Zingerman’s Deli (40 miles from track). 422 Detroit St., Ann Arbor.</p><p>With no hotels near MIS, much of the NASCAR industry scatters between places 30-50 minutes from the track. Ann Arbor is the top choice, and Zingerman’s is my favorite stop there.</p><p>This is another pretty basic pick (wow, I went out on a limb by choosing the top tourist destination), but hear me out. There’s a reason people flock to this place when they visit Ann Arbor.</p><p>If you like sandwiches, delis or both, it’s pretty hard to beat Zingerman’s. Without exaggeration, it might be the best deli in the country. That’s saying a lot when you consider New York City exists. But Zingerman’s appears to have everything, and the ingredients in whatever you choose are high quality and included in generous amounts.</p><h3>New Hampshire Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: The Barley House (14 miles from track). 132 N. Main St., Concord.</p><p>It’s an annual tradition to visit this restaurant at least once per weekend when NASCAR comes to New England. It’s one of the first places you see when driving down the main drag in Concord (a street which seems to get more attractive with every visit) and typically has a lively atmosphere inside.</p><p>There’s a wide variety of menu items and beer at The Barley House, but it’s definitely way beyond bar food quality. Whatever you order, make sure to start with a bowl of the pumpkin apple bisque.</p><h3>Phoenix Raceway</h3><p>Restaurant: Flower Child (24 miles). 100 E. Camelback Rd., Phoenix.</p><p>I really debated whether I should put Flower Child in this slot or not. It’s a growing chain of restaurants with 26 locations that include Charlotte, Washington D.C., Las Vegas, Dallas and Denver, where I live. So why pick it as the choice for Phoenix when there are plenty of places unique to the Valley? Because it’s my favorite new discovery — and that’s the only location I’ve been to.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>For years, I would go to True Food Kitchen in the Biltmore area of Phoenix. It was like healthy food disguised in an incredibly tasty way, and that was when I started making a conscious effort to eat better on the road.</p><p>True Food is still great, but they have locations everywhere now. Flower Child is a similar concept food-wise (farm-fresh, nutritious, delicious), but you order at the counter instead of having a full restaurant experience.</p><p>I’ve only eaten there twice, but one of those was my last “real” meal out before the pandemic disrupted everything. I had a squash and brussel sprouts salad topped with cooked salmon. Eight-year-old me never would have imagined I’d order something like that at a restaurant, but it was soooo good. And the menu is full of creatively healthy dishes like that.</p><p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I need to go drive to the Denver location immediately.</p><h3>Pocono Raceway</h3><p>Restaurant: Barley Creek Brewing Company (14 miles from track). 1774 Sullivan Trail, Tannersville.</p><p>I went to this place for the first time last year and was really impressed. Apparently, this restaurant/microbrewery has been there for a while, because there were plenty of people from the garage eating there. Somehow with my bad attitude about past Pocono trips, I guess I’d missed hearing about it.</p><p>Anyway, a Twitter friend recommended we meet there because it had good food and a big menu, and they were right. Plus, the waiter came over at the end and told me a mystery person had picked up the check. Turns out it was Billy Mauldin from Motor Racing Outreach. What a guy!</p><h3>Richmond Raceway</h3><p>Restaurant: Umi Sushi Bistro (13 miles from track). 11645 W. Broad St., Richmond.</p><p>I haven’t been to many restaurants in Richmond, believe it or not. Most Richmond events over the years have been night races, so more often than not, I don’t get to go out. I just stop by Wawa, load up on a sandwich and snacks and slowly eat them throughout the day and night.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>So I’m not really sure Umi is my “favorite” place, because I’ve only been there once a few years ago. The sushi was super fresh and the rolls were creative, but it was pricey. I crushed about $50 worth of sushi by myself. Frankly, it was a ridiculous scene and I hope no one saw me shoveling all the rolls into my mouth, alone.</p><p>But I’d also go back and do it again.</p><h3>Sonoma Raceway</h3><p>Restaurant: All of them</p><p>How can you pick a favorite in one of the world’s great food regions? San Francisco is only a short drive away, and I’ve gone into the city for dinner on many Sonoma trips. Then there are plenty of options in Wine Country, whether that means going to Napa, Sonoma or one of the other towns. You could drive to Sausalito for dinner near the water or check out downtown Novato or Petaluma if you’re looking for something closer.</p><p>Of all my Sonoma trips — and it’s my favorite overall trip of the season — I’m not sure I’ve ever eaten at the same place twice. There are too many great options to repeat one. But if I ever settle on a favorite, I’ll let you know.</p><h3>Talladega Superspeedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Wasabi Juan’s (49 miles from track). 2201 2nd Ave S., No. 105, Birmingham.</p><p>Sushi burritos! Ever had one? They’re one of my favorite things, and Wasabi Juan’s was the first place I ever tried one. It’s basically a big sushi roll you can hold in your hand (the white rice holds it together instead of a tortilla).</p><p>Since I last visited Birmingham, Wasabi Juan’s has outgrown its old digs and moved to a different part of town. So I can’t vouch for the location, but make sure you try the 4:20 nachos (Doritos, spicy tuna, avocado and two kinds of sauce) in addition to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a sushi burrito</a> if you go.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01221401/sushi.jpg alt width=773 height=960 sizes="(max-width: 773px) 100vw, 773px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span readability=2><p><br><span class=credits-text>Wasabi Juan’s sushi burritos (Wasabi Juan’s / Facebook)</span></p></span><h3>Texas Motor Speedway</h3><p>Restaurant: Joe T. Garcia’s (20 miles from track). 2201 N. Commerce St., Fort Worth.</p><p>How good is this place? Consider this: The restaurant seats more than 1,000 people and there’s still almost always a line to get in.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>But the line moves quickly, because — if I’m not mistaken&nbsp;<strong>—</strong> you can only order fajitas or enchiladas. That’s it. A host takes you to your table in the sprawling Spanish-style courtyard, which has fountains and archways. Your order seems to come quickly, because the kitchen is constantly making the same dishes.</p><p>You’ll have lots of NASCAR people argue for places like Hard Eight BBQ or Cattlemen’s Steak House when going to Texas — and they’re right. Those places are amazing as well.</p><p>But when it comes to Joe T. Garcia’s, sitting in a lively atmosphere underneath the Texas sky while sipping on a margarita and eating from a sizzling fajita plate? That gets P1 on my list.</p><h3>Watkins Glen International</h3><p>Restaurant: Ithaca Beer Company (27 miles from track). 122 Ithaca Beer Dr., Ithaca.</p><p>There are certainly plenty of good restaurants around the Finger Lakes region, whether that’s in Corning, Ithaca, Watkins Glen or elsewhere. Ithaca Beer Company doesn’t really fit that description; it’s a brewery that happens to have food.</p><p>But the real selling point on this place is the atmosphere. Ithaca Beer Company’s backyard, so to speak, is a green meadow. As the sun sets late on a summer evening, you can sit there with a burger and a beer and soak it all in — a porch with a fire pit nearby, surrounded by happy people lost in their own conversations.</p><p>Honestly, upstate New York is one of the most underrated summer destinations in this country. It’s so pleasant at that time of year, so to relax outside and enjoy perfect weather in a fun atmosphere is a real treat.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2020/07/01194304/Ithaca-beer.jpg alt width=1080 height=810 sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span readability=2><p><br><span class=credits-text>(Ithaca Beer Co. / Facebook)</span></p></span><p>(Top photo courtesy Jeff Gluck)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kHJnbWphaXxzfJFpZmlvX2V%2FcLPLrpqkZZ2ueqet1aipoqyVYr2trcKeqmasn2KyosCMp5yaql2arqS0jKeYrJuRp3qkwc9mqp6qmZrAbsDRmpqkZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
