MOSCOW, IDAHO: As the investigation into the Idaho murders is dragging on sans a breakthrough, the internet is digging deep into the lives of the victims, especially Kaylee Goncalves, who many believe was the intended target of the slayings. Now, a couple of old tweets from Kaylee's account have grabbed the attention of internet users. On December 8, 2017, Kaylee wrote on Twitter, “Sorry things didn’t work out, but really."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, a couple of old tweets from Kaylee's account have grabbed the attention of internet users. On December 8, 2017, Kaylee wrote on Twitter, “Sorry things didn’t work out, but really. I’m not sorry..” She then retweeted another post on March 30, 2020, which said, “Men be having GF’s 10x prettier than them & they still have the audacity to disrespect them?? Sir, go to prison.”&nbsp;</p><p>Kaylee, however, didn’t elaborate on whether these were about a breakup, or if it concerned her boyfriend at all. It was earlier revealed that Kaylee's ex-boyfriend <a href=#>Jack DuCoeur</a>, who she dated in 2019, had asked her to the prom. Goncalves also shared some photos on Instagram of herself and DuCoeur, whom many considered a suspect when it was revealed that Kaylee had tried to call him several times before her tragic death. Goncalves' sister Alivea had stated that her sister called a friend named "Jack" six times between 2.26 am and 2.44 am. Before she made a second attempt, another <a href=# rel>victim Madison Mogen</a> contacted him three times.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Lost the love of his life': Ex-BF of Idaho murder victim Kaylee Goncalves is devastated, says family</a></p><p><a href=# rel>'They would've married': University of Idaho victim Kaylee Goncalves' family backs her ex-BF Jack DuCoeur</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>sorry things didn’t work out, but really.

About the online speculations on DuCoeur being the murderer, the family remarked, “They’re just the ridiculous conspiracies. We all know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there’s no way that Jack would ever do anything like that to anybody.”</p><p>Goncalves, 21, Ethan Chapin, 20, Xana Kernodle, 20, and Madison Mogen, 21, were fatally stabbed on November 13 between 3 and 4 am as they slept in their rented house on King Road, close to the university. Earlier, police stated that the victims were stabbed several times with a "fixed-blade knife." The four victims were reportedly in a number of locations throughout Moscow before returning to the King Road house at about 1.56 am, according to police. Police were forced to amend an initial statement that said there was "no threat to the community," sparking criticism in the early phases of the inquiry.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, officials have changed their positions on a number of critical issues pertaining to the inquiry, including whether or not the other three victims happened to be in the way of a targeted attack on one of them. Cops are currently looking for a white 2011-2013 Hyundai that was spotted near the crime site earlier on November 13. Moscow police are asking anyone with information on the incident to call them at (208) 883-7054 or email them to tipline@ci.moscow.id.us.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRooV2Wum66zq1krKeip8Zut8Cyo56dXZy8r6%2FApa2eq12kuaV507CcnqyjYsGptc2gqmamn6l6uLvRpKCnn12kwrU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
