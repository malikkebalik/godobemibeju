Her advocacy for mental health, elder care, and women’s rights solidified her as a significant figure in American history.</p><p>Contrary to rumors suggesting Rosalynn Carter battled cancer, no credible sources have confirmed such news. As of the time of writing, reliable information states that she passed away on November 19, 2023, at the age of 96 due to complications arising from dementia, not cancer.</p><p>The Carter Center in Atlanta had disclosed her dementia diagnosis in May of the same year, and she had been under hospice care in her final days. Rosalynn Carter continued her philanthropic endeavors even after her time in the White House, showcasing her enduring commitment to social causes.</p><p>The absence of an official statement or credible sources linking cancer to Rosalynn Carter’s health underscores the importance of relying on verified information from reputable news outlets.
