He was in a celebrity power couple with Bananarama’s lead vocalist Keren Woodward for more than 25 years. They were regarded as the “It couple” for a considerable amount of time when they started dating in 1990.</p><p>Before dating Andrew, Keren was previously involved with David Scott-Evans, with whom she had a son named Tom. After they began dating, Andrew, Keren, and Tom relocated to Cornwall in the early 1990s. Keren, who split up with Andrew several years ago, denied having a relationship with him despite reports of a possible reconciliation. She said that they had broken up seven years before and were no longer together.</p><p>Keren said that Andrew spends the majority of his time in London and that she hadn’t seen him in a few months. Following his split from Keren, Andrew Ridgeley made his connection with Amanda Cronin public. She is a stunning model who gained notoriety for her money and 2022 marriage to Monaco energy magnate Mark Daeche. But their romance was short-lived, as they broke up almost a year after meeting.</p><p>Although Amanda thought Andrew was a great person, she wasn’t sure they could last a long time together. Despite the fact that Andrew had previously been in a committed relationship, she stated she didn’t think he was “relationship material.” Following his split from Amanda Cronin, Andrew is currently unmarried. He concluded his most recent public relationship and is still single.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kaylin Wiley</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Averie Gilley</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Sophierosejm</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>James Gregory | Comedian Health And Illness Update</a></h3>The world was astounded by the famed comic James Gregory's astonishing weight loss.
