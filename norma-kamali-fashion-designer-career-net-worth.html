In an interview, she said,</p><p><strong>“I knew I had to leave, I had $98 dollars and I left. I did not know what the hell I was going to do but I knew that I stayed, I would have no self-esteem, my worth was worthless. When I did that finally, doors were opening for me one after another. People came to offer me help and that was the biggest break. It was being brave to walk away from a relationship, from things that had gone wrong.”</strong></p><p>From that moment on, Norma is single and happy. For the time being, she is focusing more on her work.</p><h4><a title="Extinction Rebellion Protests To Produce Eco-Friendly Clothes In London Fashion Week" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extinction Rebellion Protests To Produce Eco-Friendly Clothes In London Fashion Week>></a></h4><h2>How Much Does Norma Kamali Earn?</h2><p>This 74 years old fashion designer makes a lot of money from her work.
