Peter Heck, the beloved son of Herman and Gloria (Leinbach) Heck, entered the world on February 28, 1964, in Reading. He attended and eventually graduated from Wilson High School in 1982.</p><p>Peter worked as the warehouse manager for electrical supplies at Progress Electric Supply Company for an astonishing 38 years. The only thing he was better at than mending things was doing home improvement projects. His hard work ethic shone through in the pride he had for a job well done.&nbsp;Peter’s green thumb and impressive gardening skills made his yard the envy of the neighborhood.</p><p>During the summers, he would faithfully attend his annual clamming ritual in Lewes Beach, Delaware.&nbsp;Despite all of this, Peter’s favorite things were being with his loved ones and his puppy, Chloe. His children, Sarah A. Heck, who is married to Matthew Burger, Jessica L. Strouse, who is the loving wife of Kevin Strouse, and Justin S. Heck, carry on his heritage of love.</p><p>Myla, his granddaughter, brought him much delight and pride.&nbsp;Peter’s brother Timothy Heck and cousins Bonita “Bonnie” Billman and Dean Sensenig have been incredibly supportive during this difficult period.&nbsp;On Tuesday, August 22, 2023, at 11:00 a.m., funeral services will be performed at the Edward J. Kuhn Funeral Home, Inc.,&nbsp; located at 739 Penn Avenue West in Reading, Pennsylvania.</p><p>There will be a viewing at the funeral home beginning at 10:00 a.m. On Friday, August 25, 2023, there will be a private burial service. The family would like memorial contributions be sent in Peter’s name to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, located at 501 St. Jude Place Memphis, Tennessee 38105, rather than flowers. Peter will always be remembered fondly by all who knew and loved him. I pray that he finds everlasting peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZL2mwMSrZKGdk6B6sK7Irayaqqlitq95y6itoqaXYrqmuc6rsGaalaG8t7HDZp6lnZ6YvKZ5yKVkq52jnrGmutNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
