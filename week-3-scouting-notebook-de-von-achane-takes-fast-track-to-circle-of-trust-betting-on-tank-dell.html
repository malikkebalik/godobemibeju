Video game numbers. Bo Jackson Tecmo Bowl numbers.</p><p>I’m a prototype and draft order person, so there was no way I was going to get swept away with <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=e62PvmfEiEpOm4dM href=#>De’Von Achane</a></strong> hype in the summer. But now I don’t care if he’s 80 pounds, never mind 180. When you go for 200 yards and four touchdowns, you’re in the circle of trust until you prove over multiple weeks that this was a total fluke. Obviously, everything worked for the Dolphins, but I’m not going to say we have to discount their players for that reason. That’s madness.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Miami did this all without <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=SyyCbe0kxMbPY4Ct href=#>Jaylen Waddle</a></strong>. Why, by the way, were the Dolphins trying to trade for <a class=ath_autolink data-id=mOJfkT1ezS1XnPyT href=#>Jonathan Taylor</a>, or sign <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Q99hlGEYxo2NCWBY href=#>Dalvin Cook</a>? It’s a mystery. I mean, did they even believe in <a href=#>Achane</a>? If they didn’t, why should we have?</p><p>By the way, <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=PS8eSycQR4WDFnPl href=#>Raheem Mostert</a></strong> had 4 touchdowns.</p><p><strong>Courtland Sutton</strong> has been the one good pick so far on the Broncos.</p><p>You can push the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Cowboys</a> around and the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=31 href=#>Cardinals</a> really played power football and frustrated the Dallas defense. They have a running QB and gadget running with their receivers. It’s amazing that <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=AcsKuEpShF6jjjED href=#>Joshua Dobbs</a></strong> is not a dead zone. I’m not saying he’s fertile ground, but it’s not the dust bowl in the desert. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=rk7pCoYIRoCG5SgR href=#>Marquise Brown</a></strong> is 100% playable in Flex 10 formats and is a Top 30 WR. He’s good.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Read more: The 11 most important fantasy football questions we have after Week 3</strong></a></p><p>The Cardinals played really hard. I’m not going to trash <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=1NrLfCowWevnKYEe href=#>Dak Prescott</a></strong>. The interception in the end zone was a bad decision but the game was basically over by then.</p><p>Two QB busts from the 2021 NFL Draft were expected to be veteran stars by now but instead are rendering their offenses unplayable in our game. There can’t be enough market share when you’re unlikely to generate even 200 yards of total offense in a week. That’s where we are with <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=ZOZNyO5HimYRdNoh href=#>Justin Fields</a></strong>’ <a class=ath_autolink data-id=36 href=#>Bears</a> and <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=NMsbhTzlCqTO76ld href=#>Zach Wilson</a></strong>’s Jets.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/09/25100309/GettyImages-1687513427-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1707 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>Justin Fields wonders where it all went so very wrong (Cooper Neill/Getty Images)</span><p>The major fallout is that <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=MVKA2Tjc5jrKX2Eo href=#>Garrett Wilson</a></strong> is sort of a forced play but not really someone you want to play. It was supposed to be <a class=ath_autolink data-id=jcxErAcw3SOmBLdo href=#>Aaron Rodgers</a> directing the Garrett Wilson unveiling as a fantasy star. But here we are.</p><p><strong>Dalvin Cook</strong> looks like he was bitten by the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=318IF3WpoxCZ6nxX href=#>Le’Veon Bell</a> zombie. He’s turned into a real stiff and runs with zero juice. He used to fly into and through holes, even at times in 2022, when, in fairness, he showed signs he was aging out of peak productivity.</p><p>I advised holding on to <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=whn8tlH32SbWznBB href=#>Ezekiel Elliott</a></strong> for one for week and he looked very good, better than <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=JEtNWBI0qsAxAQQJ href=#>Rhamondre Stevenson</a></strong>. We have to upgrade Elliott to a high end RB3 and make Stevenson No. 20 or so, a lower-level No. 2 back. Stevenson again was bad as a receiver. Elliot ran the way you would have expected Cook to run.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=2FClGss4NbY7sgLY href=#>Deshaun Watson</a></strong> needed to play exactly like he did. He wasn’t great but got the job done against the bad <a class=ath_autolink data-id=61 href=#>Tennessee</a> pass defense.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=NLM5eIn9uk61Nu6Y href=#>Jerome Ford</a></strong> put up the points and I wouldn’t worry about the lack of efficiency against a Tennessee defense that, for some reason, prioritizes stopping the run.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=XUAZZ3AjcOywkoZU href=#>Ryan Tannehill</a></strong> is one of the many problems at the quarterback position now. Half the teams are hopeless, at least.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=oJQx7e7sJBwSTdBo href=#>Derrick Henry</a></strong> needs to show some explosiveness next week or we worry. It’s essentially his age 30 season (he misses the cutoff barely). How many are productive at this stage of their career? Especially tall backs — Eric Dickerson was done by now, for example (the greatest tall back I can think of).</p><p><a class=ath_autolink data-id=32 href=#>Atlanta</a> snubs their noses at their elite draft talent and asks us to judge them by their record and not by stats. Well, now what? That was a pathetic exhibition against the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=41 href=#>Lions</a>. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=4nKwHYTumLD5kZWP href=#>Bijan Robinson</a></strong>, <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=KCIoZkL2iCOFp4x0 href=#>Kyle Pitts</a></strong> and <strong>Drake London</strong> combined for 122 yards from scrimmage, and that number seriously has to be 250-to-300. So, B-plus for Arthur Smith, meaning “Bad Plus Terrible”.</p><p>I would have liked <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=gflEbjWMzy96Vno7 href=#>Jahmyr Gibbs</a></strong> to do more as a receiver but he held up with his 17 carries. Why not 10 carries and seven catches, though?</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=dWkm1xu0iPqlJ5j6 href=#>Sam LaPorta</a></strong> — 11 targets — is someone you have to play now (more coming Tuesday on LaPorta). <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://x.com/CoopAFiasco/status/1706005264334275026?s%3D20&source=gmail&ust=1695698825043000&usg=AOvVaw3dILHx6AaKC_1naFPc5HQ3">The TD was a blown coverage</a>,unlikely to be replicated, but we’ll take it.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=WhulkiCmzKfAaXU7 href=#>Jared Goff</a></strong> is not remotely one of the problem QBs.

They cost themselves a lot of money. Neither should have our fantasy trust going forward.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=hKoINpSJMsyZAYt3 href=#>Jordan Love</a></strong> has made some big plays, but not consistent plays. However, we have to reserve judgment on him until his putative No. 1 WR <a class=ath_autolink data-id=e1FPMonfjkFEZUw2 href=#>Christian Watson</a> is back, assuming Watson can stay healthy when he returns (unlikely given his history going back to college).</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=48 href=#>Vikings</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=56 href=#>Chargers</a> were the Spider-Man Meme game,&nbsp;as my podcast partner and The Athletic <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.patreon.com/posts/week-3-fantasy-9-89594263?utm_medium%3Dclipboard_copy%26utm_source%3DcopyLink%26utm_campaign%3Dpostshare_creator%26utm_content%3Djoin_link&source=gmail&ust=1695698825043000&usg=AOvVaw13vn1lf3NsQvtQSkOMuVtW">colleague John Laghezza noted on our Week 3 preview</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both teams did everything they could to lose, including a failed fourth down attempt in the final minutes by the Chargers deep in their own territory when they were leading. But someone had to win.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=iPIYwkTzxrquSQo2 href=#>Kirk Cousins</a></strong> put up numbers but wasn’t good (not that we’re getting style points). The interception on the goal line wasn’t his fault but he was 4-for-14 on third down and averaged 6.4 yards per pass play — bad.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=9NHrY7HxyKCR40Kh href=#>Justin Herbert</a></strong> was unreal — 41-for-48 for 405 yards and three touchdowns. Kelley, as we said, was invisible. But things are going to get tougher for Herbert if <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=ML1CWh5B5qxLiF5o href=#>Mike Williams</a></strong> is out for the season with a knee injury, as is expected. Pick up <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=hXy9Dk8fn4feV5PE href=#>Joshua Palmer</a></strong>.</p><p>I make fun of <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=XGV9gVOFefUVWSHi href=#>Keenan Allen</a></strong> for being boring, and it is the Vikings, but come on, man, 18-for-215? We don’t care about TDs — although he did have a trick play TD pass to Mike Williams — when you put up those numbers.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=2Zv6pZ5WKRvhSYqM href=#>Jordan Addison</a></strong>’s market share stunk again. But maybe the Vikings are going to have to throw 40-to-50 times per game. Cousins is great in fantasy as a result, of course. He’s already thrown for nearly 1,100 yards and 9 TDs.</p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink data-id=34 href=#>Bills</a> have thoroughly outclassed decent teams the past two weeks.</p><p>I don’t want to be a broken record, but please trade <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=r6EKVq5tIsdjEGad href=#>Gabe Davis</a></strong>, whose fantasy ranking is so far above his market share ranking (just four targets in Week 3).</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=q0QPlrY9858wcFnP href=#>Jahan Dotson</a></strong>…? You can’t drop him, but he’s tied to a fifth-round QB who has yet to prove a thing. It’s a little better in expected offensive yardage than the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=52 href=#>Jets</a> and Bears, but not much. <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=Woo8ajcKU2H3HK2Y href=#>Sam Howell</a></strong>’s O/U for passing yards is going to be among the lowest in football next week, I suspect.</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=OiILdmCU0Ie4L8vg href=#>C.J. Stroud</a></strong> is so much better than <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=jNeXr4xrk9yhH7P4 href=#>Bryce Young</a></strong>. Come on. And, seriously, our grandmothers could have looked at both guys in shorts at the park and said, “Pick that guy,” pointing to Stroud. So when you feel like kicking yourself in the teeth over your fantasy football choices, remember that professionals get paid to pick players and do stuff like that.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=euKUJBviMVLnhXec href=#>Dameon Pierce</a></strong> had more snaps, barely, but <strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=9Ps1MFRXoDMzHOvl href=#>Devin Singletary</a></strong> appears to be a problem. I’d probably try to trade for Pierce though, not that Singletary definitely is not a problem. I’d just take my chances that he’s not a real threat.</p><p>The dynasty types loved <a href=#><strong>Tank Dell</strong></a>. He’s the furthest thing from a tank, unless you’re playing with plastic miniatures. But a bet on Dell is a bet on Stroud, and a bet I’d be willing to make. Here are more bettable stats than his actual fantasy numbers:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Tank Dell Week 3 👀</p><p>7 targets<br>5 receptions<br>145 yards<br>1 TD<br>25.5 fantasy points</p><p>This isn’t a part-time gadget player.</p><p>84% route participation 🔥<br>56% air yards 😤</p><p>Stroud looking great.</p><p>Available in 71% of Yahoo! leagues.</p><p>Talent + Opportunity –> Be aggressive if available.</p><p>— Dwain McFarland (@dwainmcfarland) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">September 25, 2023</a></p><p>Here’s Dell’s TD: &nbsp;(Okay, another blown coverage/blitz)</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Have a feeling Tank Dell won’t be available in 70% of leagues much longer 👀<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/UTtEx1Rhco</a></p><p>— Yahoo Fantasy Sports (@YahooFantasy) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2023</a></p><p><strong><a class=ath_autolink data-id=0gjixjs0a34LXvKj href=#>Trevor Lawrence</a></strong> is not a bust, but he’s not stepping up into the franchise class.
