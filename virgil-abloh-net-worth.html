He is also known for serving as the art director on the collaborative album between <a href=#>Jay-Z</a> and <a href=#>Kanye West</a> – “Watch the Throne” (2011).</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Virgil Abloh is, as of early 2017? Abloh’s wealth is estimated by authoritative sources at over $3 million, thanks to his success particularly as a fashion designer from the beginning of his work in the early years of the millennium, plus involvement in the music industry.</p><h3>Virgil Abloh Net Worth Under Review</h3><p>Virgil’s parents are Ghanaian immigrants who settled in Chicago, where he spent his childhood. After finishing at Boylan Catholic High School, Virgil enrolled at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, from which he received a degree in Civil Engineering. However, he decided that he needed a wider education, and enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Technology, from which he obtained a Master of Architecture degree.</p><p>He first came to prominent notice in 2011, after working as an art director on the “Watch the Throne” album, recorded by the two rap stars <a href=#>Kanye West</a> and <a href=#>Jay Z</a>. The whole album became a huge hit, and eventually achieved platinum status, spawning such hits as “H•A•M”, “Lift Off”, and “Why I Love You”, among others. Virgil himself received the Grammy Award for Best Recording Package nomination, propelling him into prominence in the industry. He then worked as a DJ, but in the upcoming years became more focused on the fashion industry, and launched the streetwear brand Pyrex Vision; unfortunately, this label closed after only a year.</p><p>However, Virgil didn’t drop his dreams, and in 2014 started another clothing brand – Off-White – with headquarters in Milan, Italy. He has subsequently made available luxurious clothing for both men and women through his brand, and has collaborated with several renowned artists and designers, including Takashi Murakamias and Vanessa Beecroft. Sales have also expanded through on-line advertising, so that Virgil’s net worth has continued to grow accordingly.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Virgil has been married to Shannon since 2009, however, there is no further information about the couple’s private life in the media.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/4155434_Virgil-Abloh/4155434_Runaway-2010.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjq%2Bgq5%2BZoXqirsuon2amlal6uLvRrZ9o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
